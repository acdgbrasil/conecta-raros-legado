Chapter 52. System Catalogs
The system catalogs are the place where a relational database management system stores schema
metadata, such as information about tables and columns, and internal bookkeeping information. Post-
greSQL's system catalogs are regular tables. You can drop and recreate the tables, add columns, in-
sert and update values, and severely mess up your system that way. Normally, one should not change
```
the system catalogs by hand, there are normally SQL commands to do that. (For example, CREATE
```
DATABASE inserts a row into the pg_database catalog — and actually creates the database on
```
disk.) There are some exceptions for particularly esoteric operations, but many of those have been
```
made available as SQL commands over time, and so the need for direct manipulation of the system
catalogs is ever decreasing.
52.1. Overview
Table 52.1 lists the system catalogs. More detailed documentation of each catalog follows below.
Most system catalogs are copied from the template database during database creation and are thereafter
```
database-specific. A few catalogs are physically shared across all databases in a cluster; these are noted
```
in the descriptions of the individual catalogs.

52.2. pg_aggregate
The catalog pg_aggregate stores information about aggregate functions. An aggregate function is
```
a function that operates on a set of values (typically one column from each row that matches a query
```
```
condition) and returns a single value computed from all these values. Typical aggregate functions are
```
sum, count, and max. Each entry in pg_aggregate is an extension of an entry in pg_proc. The
pg_proc entry carries the aggregate's name, input and output data types, and other information that
is similar to ordinary functions.
Table 52.2. pg_aggregate Columns
Column Type
Description
```
aggfnoid regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
pg_proc OID of the aggregate function
aggkind char
Aggregate kind: n for “normal” aggregates, o for “ordered-set” aggregates, or h for “hy-
pothetical-set” aggregates
aggnumdirectargs int2
```
Number of direct (non-aggregated) arguments of an ordered-set or hypothetical-set ag-
```
gregate, counting a variadic array as one argument. If equal to pronargs, the aggregate
must be variadic and the variadic array describes the aggregated arguments as well as the
final direct arguments. Always zero for normal aggregates.

System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
Like aggfinalmodify, but for the aggmfinalfn
```
aggsortop oid (references pg_operator.oid)
```
```
Associated sort operator (zero if none)
```
```
aggtranstype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
Data type of the aggregate function's internal transition (state) data
```
aggtransspace int4
```
Approximate average size (in bytes) of the transition state data, or zero to use a default
```

```
```
mode (zero if none)
```
aggmtransspace int4
```
Approximate average size (in bytes) of the transition state data for moving-aggregate
```
mode, or zero to use a default estimate
agginitval text
The initial value of the transition state. This is a text field containing the initial value in
its external string representation. If this field is null, the transition state value starts out
null.
aggminitval text
The initial value of the transition state for moving-aggregate mode. This is a text field
containing the initial value in its external string representation. If this field is null, the
transition state value starts out null.
New aggregate functions are registered with the CREATE AGGREGATE command. See Section 36.12
for more information about writing aggregate functions and the meaning of the transition functions,
etc.
52.3. pg_am
The catalog pg_am stores information about relation access methods. There is one row for each ac-
cess method supported by the system. Currently, only tables and indexes have access methods. The
requirements for table and index access methods are discussed in detail in Chapter 62 and Chapter 63
respectively.
Table 52.3. pg_am Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
amname name
Name of the access method
```
amhandler regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
OID of a handler function that is responsible for supplying information about the access
method
amtype char
```
t = table (including materialized views), i = index.
```
2366
System Catalogs
Note
Before PostgreSQL 9.6, pg_am contained many additional columns representing properties
of index access methods. That data is now only directly visible at the C code level. However,
```
pg_index_column_has_property() and related functions have been added to allow
```
```
SQL queries to inspect index access method properties; see Table 9.76.
```
52.4. pg_amop
The catalog pg_amop stores information about operators associated with access method operator
families. There is one row for each operator that is a member of an operator family. A family member
can be either a search operator or an ordering operator. An operator can appear in more than one
family, but cannot appear in more than one search position nor more than one ordering position within
```
a family. (It is allowed, though unlikely, for an operator to be used for both search and ordering
```
```
purposes.)
```
Table 52.4. pg_amop Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
amopfamily oid (references pg_opfamily.oid)
```
The operator family this entry is for
```
amoplefttype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Left-hand input data type of operator
```
amoprighttype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Right-hand input data type of operator
amopstrategy int2
Operator strategy number
amoppurpose char
Operator purpose, either s for search or o for ordering
```
amopopr oid (references pg_operator.oid)
```
OID of the operator
```
amopmethod oid (references pg_am.oid)
```
Index access method operator family is for
```
amopsortfamily oid (references pg_opfamily.oid)
```
```
The B-tree operator family this entry sorts according to, if an ordering operator; zero if a
```
search operator
A “search” operator entry indicates that an index of this operator family can be searched to find all
rows satisfying WHERE indexed_column operator constant. Obviously, such an operator
must return boolean, and its left-hand input type must match the index's column data type.
An “ordering” operator entry indicates that an index of this operator family can be scanned to return
rows in the order represented by ORDER BY indexed_column operator constant. Such
an operator could return any sortable data type, though again its left-hand input type must match the
index's column data type. The exact semantics of the ORDER BY are specified by the amopsort-
family column, which must reference a B-tree operator family for the operator's result type.
2367
System Catalogs
Note
At present, it's assumed that the sort order for an ordering operator is the default for the refer-
enced operator family, i.e., ASC NULLS LAST. This might someday be relaxed by adding
additional columns to specify sort options explicitly.
```
An entry's amopmethod must match the opfmethod of its containing operator family (including
```
amopmethod here is an intentional denormalization of the catalog structure for performance rea-
```
sons). Also, amoplefttype and amoprighttype must match the oprleft and oprright
```
fields of the referenced pg_operator entry.
52.5. pg_amproc
The catalog pg_amproc stores information about support functions associated with access method
operator families. There is one row for each support function belonging to an operator family.
Table 52.5. pg_amproc Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
amprocfamily oid (references pg_opfamily.oid)
```
The operator family this entry is for
```
amproclefttype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Left-hand input data type of associated operator
```
amprocrighttype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Right-hand input data type of associated operator
amprocnum int2
Support function number
```
amproc regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
OID of the function
The usual interpretation of the amproclefttype and amprocrighttype fields is that they iden-
```
tify the left and right input types of the operator(s) that a particular support function supports. For some
```
```
access methods these match the input data type(s) of the support function itself, for others not. There
```
is a notion of “default” support functions for an index, which are those with amproclefttype and
amprocrighttype both equal to the index operator class's opcintype.
52.6. pg_attrdef
The catalog pg_attrdef stores column default expressions and generation expressions. The main
information about columns is stored in pg_attribute. Only columns for which a default expres-
sion or generation expression has been explicitly set will have an entry here.
Table 52.6. pg_attrdef Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
adrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The table this column belongs to
2368
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
```
adnum int2 (references pg_attribute.attnum)
```
The number of the column
adbin pg_node_tree
```
The column default or generation expression, in nodeToString() representation. Use
```
```
pg_get_expr(adbin, adrelid) to convert it to an SQL expression.
```
52.7. pg_attribute
The catalog pg_attribute stores information about table columns. There will be exactly one
```
pg_attribute row for every column in every table in the database. (There will also be attribute
```
```
entries for indexes, and indeed all objects that have pg_class entries.)
```
The term attribute is equivalent to column and is used for historical reasons.
Table 52.7. pg_attribute Columns
Column Type
Description
```
attrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The table this column belongs to
attname name
The column name
```
atttypid oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
The data type of this column (zero for a dropped column)
```
attlen int2
A copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type
attnum int2
The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns,
```
such as ctid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.
```
atttypmod int4
```
atttypmod records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the
```
```
maximum length of a varchar column). It is passed to type-specific input functions
```
and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need
atttypmod.
attndims int2
```
Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (Presently, the num-
```
ber of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so any nonzero value effectively means
```
“it's an array”.)
```
attbyval bool
A copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type
attalign char
A copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type
attstorage char
Normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. For TOAST-able
data types, this can be altered after column creation to control storage policy.
attcompression char
The current compression method of the column. Typically this is '\0' to specify use of
```
the current default setting (see default_toast_compression). Otherwise, 'p' selects pglz
```
compression, while 'l' selects LZ4 compression. However, this field is ignored when-
ever attstorage does not allow compression.
2369
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
attnotnull bool
```
This column has a (possibly invalid) not-null constraint.
```
atthasdef bool
This column has a default expression or generation expression, in which case there will
be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the expres-
```
sion. (Check attgenerated to determine whether this is a default or a generation ex-
```
```
pression.)
```
atthasmissing bool
This column has a value which is used where the column is entirely missing from the
row, as happens when a column is added with a non-volatile DEFAULT value after the
row is created. The actual value used is stored in the attmissingval column.
attidentity char
```
If a zero byte (''), then not an identity column. Otherwise, a = generated always, d =
```
generated by default.
attgenerated char
```
If a zero byte (''), then not a generated column. Otherwise, s = stored, v = virtual. A
```
stored generated column is physically stored like a normal column. A virtual generated
column is physically stored as a null value, with the actual value being computed at run
time.
attisdropped bool
This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physical-
ly present in the table, but is ignored by the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.
attislocal bool
This column is defined locally in the relation. Note that a column can be locally defined
and inherited simultaneously.
attinhcount int2
The number of direct ancestors this column has. A column with a nonzero number of an-
cestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
```
attcollation oid (references pg_collation.oid)
```
The defined collation of the column, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type
attstattarget int2
attstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column
by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A null value
says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is
data type-dependent. For scalar data types, attstattarget is both the target number
of “most common values” to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create.
attacl aclitem[]
Column-level access privileges, if any have been granted specifically on this column
attoptions text[]
Attribute-level options, as “keyword=value” strings
attfdwoptions text[]
Attribute-level foreign data wrapper options, as “keyword=value” strings
attmissingval anyarray
This column has a one element array containing the value used when the column is en-
tirely missing from the row, as happens when the column is added with a non-volatile
DEFAULT value after the row is created. The value is only used when atthasmiss-
ing is true. If there is no value the column is null.
In a dropped column's pg_attribute entry, atttypid is reset to zero, but attlen and the other
fields copied from pg_type are still valid. This arrangement is needed to cope with the situation
2370
System Catalogs
where the dropped column's data type was later dropped, and so there is no pg_type row anymore.
attlen and the other fields can be used to interpret the contents of a row of the table.
52.8. pg_authid
```
The catalog pg_authid contains information about database authorization identifiers (roles). A role
```
subsumes the concepts of “users” and “groups”. A user is essentially just a role with the rolcan-
```
login flag set. Any role (with or without rolcanlogin) can have other roles as members; see
```
pg_auth_members.
Since this catalog contains passwords, it must not be publicly readable. pg_roles is a publicly
readable view on pg_authid that blanks out the password field.
Chapter 21 contains detailed information about user and privilege management.
Because user identities are cluster-wide, pg_authid is shared across all databases of a cluster: there
is only one copy of pg_authid per cluster, not one per database.
Table 52.8. pg_authid Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
rolname name
Role name
rolsuper bool
Role has superuser privileges
rolinherit bool
Role automatically inherits privileges of roles it is a member of
rolcreaterole bool
Role can create more roles
rolcreatedb bool
Role can create databases
rolcanlogin bool
Role can log in. That is, this role can be given as the initial session authorization identifi-
er.
rolreplication bool
Role is a replication role. A replication role can initiate replication connections and cre-
ate and drop replication slots.
rolbypassrls bool
Role bypasses every row-level security policy, see Section 5.9 for more information.
rolconnlimit int4
For roles that can log in, this sets maximum number of concurrent connections this role
can make. -1 means no limit.
rolpassword text
```
Encrypted password; null if none. The format depends on the form of encryption used.
```
rolvaliduntil timestamptz
```
Password expiry time (only used for password authentication); null if no expiration
```
For an MD5 encrypted password, rolpassword column will begin with the string md5 followed
by a 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash. The MD5 hash will be of the user's password concatenated
to their user name. For example, if user joe has password xyzzy, PostgreSQL will store the md5
hash of xyzzyjoe.
2371
System Catalogs
Warning
Support for MD5-encrypted passwords is deprecated and will be removed in a future release
of PostgreSQL. Refer to Section 20.5 for details about migrating to another password type.
If the password is encrypted with SCRAM-SHA-256, it has the format:
SCRAM-SHA-256$<iteration count>:<salt>$<StoredKey>:<ServerKey>
where salt, StoredKey and ServerKey are in Base64 encoded format. This format is the same
as that specified by RFC 58031.
52.9. pg_auth_members
The catalog pg_auth_members shows the membership relations between roles. Any non-circular
set of relationships is allowed.
Because user identities are cluster-wide, pg_auth_members is shared across all databases of a
```
cluster: there is only one copy of pg_auth_members per cluster, not one per database.
```
Table 52.9. pg_auth_members Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
roleid oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
ID of a role that has a member
```
member oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
ID of a role that is a member of roleid
```
grantor oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
ID of the role that granted this membership
admin_option bool
True if member can grant membership in roleid to others
inherit_option bool
True if the member automatically inherits the privileges of the granted role
set_option bool
True if the member can SET ROLE to the granted role
52.10. pg_cast
The catalog pg_cast stores data type conversion paths, both built-in and user-defined.
It should be noted that pg_cast does not represent every type conversion that the system knows how
```
to perform; only those that cannot be deduced from some generic rule. For example, casting between
```
a domain and its base type is not explicitly represented in pg_cast. Another important exception
is that “automatic I/O conversion casts”, those performed using a data type's own I/O functions to
convert to or from text or other string types, are not explicitly represented in pg_cast.

2372
System Catalogs
Table 52.10. pg_cast Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
castsource oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
OID of the source data type
```
casttarget oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
OID of the target data type
```
castfunc oid (references pg_proc.oid)
```
The OID of the function to use to perform this cast. Zero is stored if the cast method
doesn't require a function.
castcontext char
```
Indicates what contexts the cast can be invoked in. e means only as an explicit cast (us-
```
```
ing CAST or :: syntax). a means implicitly in assignment to a target column, as well as
```
explicitly. i means implicitly in expressions, as well as the other cases.
castmethod char
Indicates how the cast is performed. f means that the function specified in the cast-
func field is used. i means that the input/output functions are used. b means that the
types are binary-coercible, thus no conversion is required.
The cast functions listed in pg_cast must always take the cast source type as their first argument
type, and return the cast destination type as their result type. A cast function can have up to three
```
arguments. The second argument, if present, must be type integer; it receives the type modifier
```
associated with the destination type, or -1 if there is none. The third argument, if present, must be type
```
boolean; it receives true if the cast is an explicit cast, false otherwise.
```
It is legitimate to create a pg_cast entry in which the source and target types are the same, if the
associated function takes more than one argument. Such entries represent “length coercion functions”
that coerce values of the type to be legal for a particular type modifier value.
When a pg_cast entry has different source and target types and a function that takes more than one
argument, it represents converting from one type to another and applying a length coercion in a single
step. When no such entry is available, coercion to a type that uses a type modifier involves two steps,
one to convert between data types and a second to apply the modifier.
52.11. pg_class
The catalog pg_class describes tables and other objects that have columns or are otherwise similar
```
to a table. This includes indexes (but see also pg_index), sequences (but see also pg_sequence),
```
```
views, materialized views, composite types, and TOAST tables; see relkind. Below, when we mean
```
all of these kinds of objects we speak of “relations”. Not all of pg_class's columns are meaningful
for all relation kinds.
Table 52.11. pg_class Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
relname name
Name of the table, index, view, etc.
```
relnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
```
The OID of the namespace that contains this relation
2373
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
```
reltype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
The OID of the data type that corresponds to this table's row type, if any; zero for index-
```
es, sequences, and toast tables, which have no pg_type entry
```
reloftype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
For typed tables, the OID of the underlying composite type; zero for all other relations
```
```
relowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the relation
```
relam oid (references pg_am.oid)
```
The access method used to access this table or index. Not meaningful if the relation is a
sequence or has no on-disk file, except for partitioned tables, where, if set, it takes prece-
dence over default_table_access_method when determining the access method
to use for partitions created when one is not specified in the creation command.
relfilenode oid
```
Name of the on-disk file of this relation; zero means this is a “mapped” relation whose
```
disk file name is determined by low-level state
```
reltablespace oid (references pg_tablespace.oid)
```
The tablespace in which this relation is stored. If zero, the database's default tablespace is
implied. Not meaningful if the relation has no on-disk file, except for partitioned tables,
where this is the tablespace in which partitions will be created when one is not specified
in the creation command.
relpages int4
```
Size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (of size BLCKSZ). This is only an
```
estimate used by the planner. It is updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL com-
mands such as CREATE INDEX.
reltuples float4
Number of live rows in the table. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is up-
dated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX. If
the table has never yet been vacuumed or analyzed, reltuples contains -1 indicating
that the row count is unknown.
relallvisible int4
Number of pages that are marked all-visible in the table's visibility map. This is only an
estimate used by the planner. It is updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL com-
mands such as CREATE INDEX.
relallfrozen int4
Number of pages that are marked all-frozen in the table's visibility map. This is only an
estimate used for triggering autovacuums. It can also be used along with relallvisi-
ble for scheduling manual vacuums and tuning vacuum's freezing behavior. It is updat-
ed by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX.
```
reltoastrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
OID of the TOAST table associated with this table, zero if none. The TOAST table stores
large attributes “out of line” in a secondary table.
relhasindex bool
```
True if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes
```
relisshared bool
True if this table is shared across all databases in the cluster. Only certain system cata-
```
logs (such as pg_database) are shared.
```
relpersistence char
```
p = permanent table/sequence, u = unlogged table/sequence, t = temporary table/se-

bound
Several of the Boolean flags in pg_class are maintained lazily: they are guaranteed to be true if
that's the correct state, but may not be reset to false immediately when the condition is no longer true.
For example, relhasindex is set by CREATE INDEX, but it is never cleared by DROP INDEX.
Instead, VACUUM clears relhasindex if it finds the table has no indexes. This arrangement avoids
race conditions and improves concurrency.
52.12. pg_collation
The catalog pg_collation describes the available collations, which are essentially mappings from
an SQL name to operating system locale categories. See Section 23.2 for more information.
Table 52.12. pg_collation Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
collname name
```
Collation name (unique per namespace and encoding)
```
```
collnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
```
The OID of the namespace that contains this collation
```
collowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the collation
collprovider char
Provider of the collation: d = database default, b = builtin, c = libc, i = icu
collisdeterministic bool
Is the collation deterministic?
collencoding int4
Encoding in which the collation is applicable, or -1 if it works for any encoding
collcollate text
LC_COLLATE for this collation object. If the provider is not libc, collcollate is
NULL and colllocale is used instead.
collctype text
LC_CTYPE for this collation object. If the provider is not libc, collctype is NULL
and colllocale is used instead.
colllocale text
Collation provider locale name for this collation object. If the provider is libc, coll-
```
locale is NULL; collcollate and collctype are used instead.
```
collicurules text
ICU collation rules for this collation object
collversion text
Provider-specific version of the collation. This is recorded when the collation is created
and then checked when it is used, to detect changes in the collation definition that could
lead to data corruption.
```
Note that the unique key on this catalog is (collname, collencoding, collnamespace) not
```
```
just (collname, collnamespace). PostgreSQL generally ignores all collations that do not have
```
2376
System Catalogs
collencoding equal to either the current database's encoding or -1, and creation of new entries
with the same name as an entry with collencoding = -1 is forbidden. Therefore it is sufficient
```
to use a qualified SQL name (schema.name) to identify a collation, even though this is not unique
```
according to the catalog definition. The reason for defining the catalog this way is that initdb fills it
in at cluster initialization time with entries for all locales available on the system, so it must be able
to hold entries for all encodings that might ever be used in the cluster.
In the template0 database, it could be useful to create collations whose encoding does not match the
database encoding, since they could match the encodings of databases later cloned from template0.
This would currently have to be done manually.
52.13. pg_constraint
The catalog pg_constraint stores check, not-null, primary key, unique, foreign key, and exclu-
```
sion constraints on tables. (Column constraints are not treated specially. Every column constraint is
```
```
equivalent to some table constraint.)
```
```
User-defined constraint triggers (created with CREATE CONSTRAINT TRIGGER) also give rise
```
to an entry in this table.
Check constraints on domains are stored here, too.

This constraint is defined locally for the relation. Note that a constraint can be locally de-
fined and inherited simultaneously.

The number of direct inheritance ancestors this constraint has. A constraint with a nonze-
ro number of ancestors cannot be dropped nor renamed.
connoinherit bool
This constraint is defined locally for the relation. It is a non-inheritable constraint.

```
use pg_get_constraintdef() to extract the definition of a check constraint.)

In the case of an exclusion constraint, conkey is only useful for constraint elements that are simple
column references. For other cases, a zero appears in conkey and the associated index must be con-
```
sulted to discover the expression that is constrained. (conkey thus has the same contents as pg_in-
```
```
dex.indkey for the index.)
```
2378
System Catalogs
Note
pg_class.relchecks needs to agree with the number of check-constraint entries found
in this table for each relation.

52.15. pg_database
The catalog pg_database stores information about the available databases. Databases are created
with the CREATE DATABASE command. Consult Chapter 22 for details about the meaning of some
of the parameters.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_database is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only
one copy of pg_database per cluster, not one per database.

datallowconn bool
If false then no one can connect to this database. This is used to protect the template0
database from being altered.
dathasloginevt bool

avoid extra lookups on the pg_event_trigger table during each backend startup.
This flag is used internally by PostgreSQL and should not be manually altered or read for
monitoring purposes.

means no limit, -2 indicates the database is invalid.
datfrozenxid xid

All transaction IDs before this one have been replaced with a permanent (“frozen”) trans-
```
action ID in this database. This is used to track whether the database needs to be vacu-
umed in order to prevent transaction ID wraparound or to allow pg_xact to be shrunk.
It is the minimum of the per-table pg_class.relfrozenxid values.
datminmxid xid
All multixact IDs before this one have been replaced with a transaction ID in this data-
base. This is used to track whether the database needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent
multixact ID wraparound or to allow pg_multixact to be shrunk. It is the minimum

52.16. pg_db_role_setting
The catalog pg_db_role_setting records the default values that have been set for run-time con-
figuration variables, for each role and database combination.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_db_role_setting is shared across all databases of a cluster:
there is only one copy of pg_db_role_setting per cluster, not one per database.

defaclobjtype char
```

```
= type, n = schema, L = large object
defaclacl aclitem[]
Access privileges that this type of object should have on creation
A pg_default_acl entry shows the initial privileges to be assigned to an object belonging to the
indicated user. There are currently two types of entry: “global” entries with defaclnamespace =
zero, and “per-schema” entries that reference a particular schema. If a global entry is present then it
overrides the normal hard-wired default privileges for the object type. A per-schema entry, if present,
represents privileges to be added to the global or hard-wired default privileges.
Note that when an ACL entry in another catalog is null, it is taken to represent the hard-wired de-
fault privileges for its object, not whatever might be in pg_default_acl at the moment. pg_de-
fault_acl is only consulted during object creation.
52.18. pg_depend
The catalog pg_depend records the dependency relationships between database objects. This infor-
mation allows DROP commands to find which other objects must be dropped by DROP CASCADE or
prevent dropping in the DROP RESTRICT case.
2381
System Catalogs
See also pg_shdepend, which performs a similar function for dependencies involving objects that
are shared across a database cluster.
Table 52.18. pg_depend Columns
Column Type
Description
```
classid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog the dependent object is in
```
objid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the specific dependent object
objsubid int4
```
For a table column, this is the column number (the objid and classid refer to the ta-
```
```
ble itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
```
refclassid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog the referenced object is in
```
refobjid oid (references any OID column)

```
For a table column, this is the column number (the refobjid and refclassid refer
```
```
to the table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
deptype char
```
A code defining the specific semantics of this dependency relationship; see text
```
In all cases, a pg_depend entry indicates that the referenced object cannot be dropped without also
dropping the dependent object. However, there are several subflavors identified by deptype:
```
DEPENDENCY_NORMAL (n)
```
A normal relationship between separately-created objects. The dependent object can be dropped
without affecting the referenced object. The referenced object can only be dropped by specifying
CASCADE, in which case the dependent object is dropped, too. Example: a table column has a
normal dependency on its data type.
```
DEPENDENCY_AUTO (a)
```
The dependent object can be dropped separately from the referenced object, and should be au-
```
tomatically dropped (regardless of RESTRICT or CASCADE mode) if the referenced object is
```
dropped. Example: a named constraint on a table is made auto-dependent on the table, so that it
will go away if the table is dropped.
```
DEPENDENCY_INTERNAL (i)
```
The dependent object was created as part of creation of the referenced object, and is really just
a part of its internal implementation. A direct DROP of the dependent object will be disallowed
```
outright (we'll tell the user to issue a DROP against the referenced object, instead). A DROP of the
```
referenced object will result in automatically dropping the dependent object whether CASCADE
is specified or not. If the dependent object has to be dropped due to a dependency on some other
object being removed, its drop is converted to a drop of the referenced object, so that NORMAL
and AUTO dependencies of the dependent object behave much like they were dependencies of
the referenced object. Example: a view's ON SELECT rule is made internally dependent on the
```
view, preventing it from being dropped while the view remains. Dependencies of the rule (such
```
```
as tables it refers to) act as if they were dependencies of the view.
```
2382
System Catalogs
```
DEPENDENCY_PARTITION_PRI (P)
```
```
DEPENDENCY_PARTITION_SEC (S)
```
The dependent object was created as part of creation of the referenced object, and is really just
```
a part of its internal implementation; however, unlike INTERNAL, there is more than one such
```
referenced object. The dependent object must not be dropped unless at least one of these refer-
```
enced objects is dropped; if any one is, the dependent object should be dropped whether or not
```
CASCADE is specified. Also unlike INTERNAL, a drop of some other object that the dependent
object depends on does not result in automatic deletion of any partition-referenced object. Hence,
if the drop does not cascade to at least one of these objects via some other path, it will be re-
```
fused. (In most cases, the dependent object shares all its non-partition dependencies with at least
```
one partition-referenced object, so that this restriction does not result in blocking any cascaded
```
delete.) Primary and secondary partition dependencies behave identically except that the primary
```
```
dependency is preferred for use in error messages; hence, a partition-dependent object should
```
have one primary partition dependency and one or more secondary partition dependencies. Note
that partition dependencies are made in addition to, not instead of, any dependencies the object
would normally have. This simplifies ATTACH/DETACH PARTITION operations: the partition
dependencies need only be added or removed. Example: a child partitioned index is made parti-
tion-dependent on both the partition table it is on and the parent partitioned index, so that it goes
away if either of those is dropped, but not otherwise. The dependency on the parent index is pri-
mary, so that if the user tries to drop the child partitioned index, the error message will suggest
```
dropping the parent index instead (not the table).
```
```
DEPENDENCY_EXTENSION (e)
```
```
The dependent object is a member of the extension that is the referenced object (see pg_exten-
```
```
sion). The dependent object can be dropped only via DROP EXTENSION on the referenced
```
object. Functionally this dependency type acts the same as an INTERNAL dependency, but it's
kept separate for clarity and to simplify pg_dump.
```
DEPENDENCY_AUTO_EXTENSION (x)
```
```
The dependent object is not a member of the extension that is the referenced object (and so it
```
```
should not be ignored by pg_dump), but it cannot function without the extension and should
```
be auto-dropped if the extension is. The dependent object may be dropped on its own as well.
Functionally this dependency type acts the same as an AUTO dependency, but it's kept separate
for clarity and to simplify pg_dump.
Other dependency flavors might be needed in future.
Note that it's quite possible for two objects to be linked by more than one pg_depend entry. For
example, a child partitioned index would have both a partition-type dependency on its associated par-
tition table, and an auto dependency on each column of that table that it indexes. This sort of situation
expresses the union of multiple dependency semantics. A dependent object can be dropped without
CASCADE if any of its dependencies satisfies its condition for automatic dropping. Conversely, all the
dependencies' restrictions about which objects must be dropped together must be satisfied.
Most objects created during initdb are considered “pinned”, which means that the system itself depends
on them. Therefore, they are never allowed to be dropped. Also, knowing that pinned objects will
not be dropped, the dependency mechanism doesn't bother to make pg_depend entries showing
dependencies on them. Thus, for example, a table column of type numeric notionally has a NORMAL
dependency on the numeric data type, but no such entry actually appears in pg_depend.
52.19. pg_description
```
The catalog pg_description stores optional descriptions (comments) for each database object.
```
Descriptions can be manipulated with the COMMENT command and viewed with psql's \d commands.
Descriptions of many built-in system objects are provided in the initial contents of pg_descrip-
tion.
2383

See also pg_shdescription, which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects
that are shared across a database cluster.

```
objoid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the object this description pertains to
```
classoid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog this object appears in
objsubid int4
```
For a comment on a table column, this is the column number (the objoid and clas-
```
```
soid refer to the table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
description text
Arbitrary text that serves as the description of this object
52.20. pg_enum
The pg_enum catalog contains entries showing the values and labels for each enum type. The internal
representation of a given enum value is actually the OID of its associated row in pg_enum.
Table 52.20. pg_enum Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
enumtypid oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_type entry owning this enum value
enumsortorder float4
The sort position of this enum value within its enum type
enumlabel name
The textual label for this enum value
The OIDs for pg_enum rows follow a special rule: even-numbered OIDs are guaranteed to be ordered
in the same way as the sort ordering of their enum type. That is, if two even OIDs belong to the same
enum type, the smaller OID must have the smaller enumsortorder value. Odd-numbered OID
values need bear no relationship to the sort order. This rule allows the enum comparison routines to
avoid catalog lookups in many common cases. The routines that create and alter enum types attempt
to assign even OIDs to enum values whenever possible.
When an enum type is created, its members are assigned sort-order positions 1..n. But members added
later might be given negative or fractional values of enumsortorder. The only requirement on
these values is that they be correctly ordered and unique within each enum type.
52.21. pg_event_trigger
The catalog pg_event_trigger stores event triggers. See Chapter 38 for more information.

52.22. pg_extension
The catalog pg_extension stores information about the installed extensions. See Section 36.17
for details about extensions.
Table 52.22. pg_extension Columns

```
extcondition text[]
```
Array of WHERE-clause filter conditions for the extension's configuration table(s), or
```
NULL if none
Note that unlike most catalogs with a “namespace” column, extnamespace is not meant to im-
ply that the extension belongs to that schema. Extension names are never schema-qualified. Rather,
extnamespace indicates the schema that contains most or all of the extension's objects. If extre-
locatable is true, then this schema must in fact contain all schema-qualifiable objects belonging
to the extension.

entry contains the information that is pertinent only to foreign tables and not any other kind of relation.
Table 52.25. pg_foreign_table Columns
Column Type
Description
```
ftrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for this foreign table
```
ftserver oid (references pg_foreign_server.oid)
```
OID of the foreign server for this foreign table
ftoptions text[]
Foreign table options, as “keyword=value” strings
52.26. pg_index
The catalog pg_index contains part of the information about indexes. The rest is mostly in
pg_class.
Table 52.26. pg_index Columns
Column Type
Description
```
indexrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for this index
```
indrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for the table this index is for
indnatts int2
```
The total number of columns in the index (duplicates pg_class.relnatts); this
```
number includes both key and included attributes
indnkeyatts int2
The number of key columns in the index, not counting any included columns, which are
merely stored and do not participate in the index semantics
indisunique bool
If true, this is a unique index
indnullsnotdistinct bool
This value is only used for unique indexes. If false, this unique index will consider null
```
values distinct (so the index can contain multiple null values in a column, the default
```
```
PostgreSQL behavior). If it is true, it will consider null values to be equal (so the index
```
```
can only contain one null value in a column).
```
indisprimary bool
```
If true, this index represents the primary key of the table (indisunique should always
```
```
be true when this is true)
```
indisexclusion bool
If true, this index supports an exclusion constraint
2387
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
indimmediate bool
```
If true, the uniqueness check is enforced immediately on insertion (irrelevant if indis-
```
```
unique is not true)
```
indisclustered bool
If true, the table was last clustered on this index
indisvalid bool
If true, the index is currently valid for queries. False means the index is possibly incom-
```
plete: it must still be modified by INSERT/UPDATE operations, but it cannot safely be
```
used for queries. If it is unique, the uniqueness property is not guaranteed true either.
indcheckxmin bool
If true, queries must not use the index until the xmin of this pg_index row is below
their TransactionXmin event horizon, because the table may contain broken HOT
chains with incompatible rows that they can see
indisready bool
If true, the index is currently ready for inserts. False means the index must be ignored by
INSERT/UPDATE operations.
indislive bool
If false, the index is in process of being dropped, and should be ignored for all purposes
```
(including HOT-safety decisions)
```
indisreplident bool
If true this index has been chosen as “replica identity” using ALTER TABLE ... RE-
PLICA IDENTITY USING INDEX ...
```
indkey int2vector (references pg_attribute.attnum)
```
This is an array of indnatts values that indicate which table columns this index in-
dexes. For example, a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table columns
```
make up the index entries. Key columns come before non-key (included) columns. A ze-
```
ro in this array indicates that the corresponding index attribute is an expression over the
table columns, rather than a simple column reference.
```
indcollation oidvector (references pg_collation.oid)
```
```
For each column in the index key (indnkeyatts values), this contains the OID of the
```
collation to use for the index, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type.
```
indclass oidvector (references pg_opclass.oid)
```
```
For each column in the index key (indnkeyatts values), this contains the OID of the
```
operator class to use. See pg_opclass for details.
indoption int2vector
This is an array of indnkeyatts values that store per-column flag bits. The meaning
of the bits is defined by the index's access method.
indexprs pg_node_tree
```
Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for index attributes that are not
```
simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in indkey.
Null if all index attributes are simple references.
indpred pg_node_tree
```
Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for partial index predicate. Null
```
if not a partial index.
52.27. pg_inherits
The catalog pg_inherits records information about table and index inheritance hierarchies. There
```
is one entry for each direct parent-child table or index relationship in the database. (Indirect inheritance
```
```
can be determined by following chains of entries.)
```
2388
System Catalogs
Table 52.27. pg_inherits Columns
Column Type
Description
```
inhrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the child table or index
```
inhparent oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the parent table or index
inhseqno int4
```
If there is more than one direct parent for a child table (multiple inheritance), this number
```
tells the order in which the inherited columns are to be arranged. The count starts at 1.
Indexes cannot have multiple inheritance, since they can only inherit when using declara-
tive partitioning.
inhdetachpending bool
```
true for a partition that is in the process of being detached; false otherwise.
```
52.28. pg_init_privs
The catalog pg_init_privs records information about the initial privileges of objects in the sys-
```
tem. There is one entry for each object in the database which has a non-default (non-NULL) initial
```
set of privileges.
Objects can have initial privileges either by having those privileges set when the system is initialized
```
(by initdb) or when the object is created during a CREATE EXTENSION and the extension script sets
```
initial privileges using the GRANT system. Note that the system will automatically handle recording
of the privileges during the extension script and that extension authors need only use the GRANT and
REVOKE statements in their script to have the privileges recorded. The privtype column indicates
if the initial privilege was set by initdb or during a CREATE EXTENSION command.
Objects which have initial privileges set by initdb will have entries where privtype is 'i', while
objects which have initial privileges set by CREATE EXTENSION will have entries where privtype
is 'e'.
Table 52.28. pg_init_privs Columns
Column Type
Description
```
objoid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the specific object
```
classoid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog the object is in
objsubid int4
```
For a table column, this is the column number (the objoid and classoid refer to the
```
```
table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
privtype char
```
A code defining the type of initial privilege of this object; see text
```
initprivs aclitem[]
```
The initial access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
```
52.29. pg_language
The catalog pg_language registers languages in which you can write functions or stored proce-
dures. See CREATE LANGUAGE and Chapter 40 for more information about language handlers.
2389
System Catalogs
Table 52.29. pg_language Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
lanname name
Name of the language
```
lanowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the language
lanispl bool
```
This is false for internal languages (such as SQL) and true for user-defined languages.
```
Currently, pg_dump still uses this to determine which languages need to be dumped, but
this might be replaced by a different mechanism in the future.
lanpltrusted bool
True if this is a trusted language, which means that it is believed not to grant access to
anything outside the normal SQL execution environment. Only superusers can create
functions in untrusted languages.
```
lanplcallfoid oid (references pg_proc.oid)
```
For noninternal languages this references the language handler, which is a special func-
tion that is responsible for executing all functions that are written in the particular lan-
guage. Zero for internal languages.
```
laninline oid (references pg_proc.oid)
```
This references a function that is responsible for executing “inline” anonymous code
```
blocks (DO blocks). Zero if inline blocks are not supported.
```
```
lanvalidator oid (references pg_proc.oid)
```
This references a language validator function that is responsible for checking the syntax
and validity of new functions when they are created. Zero if no validator is provided.
lanacl aclitem[]
```
Access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
```
52.30. pg_largeobject
The catalog pg_largeobject holds the data making up “large objects”. A large object is identified
by an OID assigned when it is created. Each large object is broken into segments or “pages” small
enough to be conveniently stored as rows in pg_largeobject. The amount of data per page is
```
defined to be LOBLKSIZE (which is currently BLCKSZ/4, or typically 2 kB).
```
Prior to PostgreSQL 9.0, there was no permission structure associated with large objects. As a result,
```
pg_largeobject was publicly readable and could be used to obtain the OIDs (and contents) of
```
```
all large objects in the system. This is no longer the case; use pg_largeobject_metadata to
```
obtain a list of large object OIDs.
Table 52.30. pg_largeobject Columns
Column Type
Description
```
loid oid (references pg_largeobject_metadata.oid)
```
Identifier of the large object that includes this page
pageno int4
```
Page number of this page within its large object (counting from zero)
```
data bytea
2390
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
Actual data stored in the large object. This will never be more than LOBLKSIZE bytes
and might be less.
Each row of pg_largeobject holds data for one page of a large object, beginning at byte offset
```
(pageno * LOBLKSIZE) within the object. The implementation allows sparse storage: pages might
```
be missing, and might be shorter than LOBLKSIZE bytes even if they are not the last page of the
object. Missing regions within a large object read as zeroes.
52.31. pg_largeobject_metadata
The catalog pg_largeobject_metadata holds metadata associated with large objects. The ac-
tual large object data is stored in pg_largeobject.
Table 52.31. pg_largeobject_metadata Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
lomowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the large object
lomacl aclitem[]
```
Access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
```
52.32. pg_namespace
The catalog pg_namespace stores namespaces. A namespace is the structure underlying SQL
```
schemas: each namespace can have a separate collection of relations, types, etc. without name con-
```
flicts.
Table 52.32. pg_namespace Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
nspname name
Name of the namespace
```
nspowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the namespace
nspacl aclitem[]
```
Access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
```
52.33. pg_opclass
The catalog pg_opclass defines index access method operator classes. Each operator class defines
semantics for index columns of a particular data type and a particular index access method. An oper-
ator class essentially specifies that a particular operator family is applicable to a particular indexable
column data type. The set of operators from the family that are actually usable with the indexed col-
umn are whichever ones accept the column's data type as their left-hand input.
Operator classes are described at length in Section 36.16.
2391
System Catalogs
Table 52.33. pg_opclass Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
opcmethod oid (references pg_am.oid)
```
Index access method operator class is for
opcname name

```
opcintype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Data type that the operator class indexes
opcdefault bool
True if this operator class is the default for opcintype
```
opckeytype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Type of data stored in index, or zero if same as opcintype
An operator class's opcmethod must match the opfmethod of its containing operator family. Also,
there must be no more than one pg_opclass row having opcdefault true for any given combi-
nation of opcmethod and opcintype.
52.34. pg_operator
The catalog pg_operator stores information about operators. See CREATE OPERATOR and Sec-
tion 36.14 for more information.

```
```
oprjoin regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
```
Join selectivity estimation function for this operator (zero if none)
```
52.35. pg_opfamily
The catalog pg_opfamily defines operator families. Each operator family is a collection of oper-
ators and associated support routines that implement the semantics specified for a particular index
access method. Furthermore, the operators in a family are all “compatible”, in a way that is specified
by the access method. The operator family concept allows cross-data-type operators to be used with
indexes and to be reasoned about using knowledge of access method semantics.
Operator families are described at length in Section 36.16.
Table 52.35. pg_opfamily Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
opfmethod oid (references pg_am.oid)
```
Index access method operator family is for
opfname name
Name of this operator family
```
opfnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
```

```
Owner of the operator family
The majority of the information defining an operator family is not in its pg_opfamily row, but in
the associated rows in pg_amop, pg_amproc, and pg_opclass.
52.36. pg_parameter_acl
The catalog pg_parameter_acl records configuration parameters for which privileges have been
granted to one or more roles. No entry is made for parameters that have default privileges.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_parameter_acl is shared across all databases of a cluster: there
is only one copy of pg_parameter_acl per cluster, not one per database.
2393
System Catalogs
Table 52.36. pg_parameter_acl Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
parname text
The name of a configuration parameter for which privileges are granted
paracl aclitem[]

52.37. pg_partitioned_table
The catalog pg_partitioned_table stores information about how tables are partitioned.
Table 52.37. pg_partitioned_table Columns
Column Type
Description
```
partrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for this partitioned table
partstrat char
```

```
titioned table
partnatts int2
The number of columns in the partition key
```
partdefid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for the default partition of this partitioned table, or ze-
ro if this partitioned table does not have a default partition
```
partattrs int2vector (references pg_attribute.attnum)
```
This is an array of partnatts values that indicate which table columns are part of the
partition key. For example, a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table
columns make up the partition key. A zero in this array indicates that the corresponding
partition key column is an expression, rather than a simple column reference.
```
partclass oidvector (references pg_opclass.oid)
```
For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the operator class to use.
See pg_opclass for details.
```
partcollation oidvector (references pg_collation.oid)
```
For each column in the partition key, this contains the OID of the collation to use for par-
titioning, or zero if the column is not of a collatable data type.
partexprs pg_node_tree
```
Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for partition key columns that
```
are not simple column references. This is a list with one element for each zero entry in
partattrs. Null if all partition key columns are simple references.
52.38. pg_policy
The catalog pg_policy stores row-level security policies for tables. A policy includes the kind of
```
command that it applies to (possibly all commands), the roles that it applies to, the expression to be
```
added as a security-barrier qualification to queries that include the table, and the expression to be
added as a WITH CHECK option for queries that attempt to add new records to the table.
2394
System Catalogs
Table 52.38. pg_policy Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
polname name
The name of the policy
```
polrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The table to which the policy applies
polcmd char
The command type to which the policy is applied: r for SELECT, a for INSERT, w for
UPDATE, d for DELETE, or * for all
polpermissive bool
Is the policy permissive or restrictive?
```
polroles oid[] (references pg_authid.oid)
```
```
The roles to which the policy is applied; zero means PUBLIC (and normally appears
```
```
alone in the array)
```
polqual pg_node_tree
The expression tree to be added to the security barrier qualifications for queries that use
the table
polwithcheck pg_node_tree
The expression tree to be added to the WITH CHECK qualifications for queries that at-
tempt to add rows to the table
Note
Policies stored in pg_policy are applied only when pg_class.relrowsecurity is set
for their table.
52.39. pg_proc
The catalog pg_proc stores information about functions, procedures, aggregate functions, and win-
```
dow functions (collectively also known as routines). See CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCE-
```
DURE, and Section 36.3 for more information.
If prokind indicates that the entry is for an aggregate function, there should be a matching row in
pg_aggregate.
Table 52.39. pg_proc Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
proname name
Name of the function
```
pronamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)

```
proowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the function
```
prolang oid (references pg_language.oid)
```
2395
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
Implementation language or call interface of this function
procost float4
```
Estimated execution cost (in units of cpu_operator_cost); if proretset, this is cost per
```
row returned
prorows float4
```
Estimated number of result rows (zero if not proretset)
```
```
provariadic oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Data type of the variadic array parameter's elements, or zero if the function does not have
a variadic parameter
```
prosupport regproc (references pg_proc.oid)

```
Planner support function for this function (see Section 36.11), or zero if none
```
prokind char
f for a normal function, p for a procedure, a for an aggregate function, or w for a win-
dow function
prosecdef bool
```
Function is a security definer (i.e., a “setuid” function)
```
proleakproof bool
The function has no side effects. No information about the arguments is conveyed except
via the return value. Any function that might throw an error depending on the values of
its arguments is not leakproof.
proisstrict bool
Function returns null if any call argument is null. In that case the function won't actually
be called at all. Functions that are not “strict” must be prepared to handle null inputs.
proretset bool
```
Function returns a set (i.e., multiple values of the specified data type)
```
provolatile char
provolatile tells whether the function's result depends only on its input arguments,
or is affected by outside factors. It is i for “immutable” functions, which always deliver
```
the same result for the same inputs. It is s for “stable” functions, whose results (for fixed
```
```
inputs) do not change within a scan. It is v for “volatile” functions, whose results might
```
```
change at any time. (Use v also for functions with side-effects, so that calls to them can-
```
```
not get optimized away.)
```
proparallel char
proparallel tells whether the function can be safely run in parallel mode. It is s
for functions which are safe to run in parallel mode without restriction. It is r for func-
tions which can be run in parallel mode, but their execution is restricted to the parallel
```
group leader; parallel worker processes cannot invoke these functions. It is u for func-
```
```
tions which are unsafe in parallel mode; the presence of such a function forces a serial
```
execution plan.
pronargs int2
Number of input arguments
pronargdefaults int2
Number of arguments that have defaults
```
prorettype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Data type of the return value
```
proargtypes oidvector (references pg_type.oid)
```
An array of the data types of the function arguments. This includes only input arguments
```
(including INOUT and VARIADIC arguments), and thus represents the call signature of
```
the function.
2396
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
```
proallargtypes oid[] (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
An array of the data types of the function arguments. This includes all arguments (in-
```
```
cluding OUT and INOUT arguments); however, if all the arguments are IN arguments,
```
this field will be null. Note that subscripting is 1-based, whereas for historical reasons
proargtypes is subscripted from 0.
proargmodes char[]
An array of the modes of the function arguments, encoded as i for IN arguments, o for
OUT arguments, b for INOUT arguments, v for VARIADIC arguments, t for TABLE
arguments. If all the arguments are IN arguments, this field will be null. Note that sub-
scripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not proargtypes.
proargnames text[]
An array of the names of the function arguments. Arguments without a name are set
to empty strings in the array. If none of the arguments have a name, this field will
be null. Note that subscripts correspond to positions of proallargtypes not
proargtypes.
proargdefaults pg_node_tree
```
Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for default values. This is a list
```
```
with pronargdefaults elements, corresponding to the last N input arguments (i.e.,
```
```
the last N proargtypes positions). If none of the arguments have defaults, this field
```
will be null.
```
protrftypes oid[] (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
An array of the argument/result data type(s) for which to apply transforms (from the
```
```
function's TRANSFORM clause). Null if none.
```
prosrc text
This tells the function handler how to invoke the function. It might be the actual source
code of the function for interpreted languages, a link symbol, a file name, or just about
anything else, depending on the implementation language/call convention.
probin text
Additional information about how to invoke the function. Again, the interpretation is lan-
guage-specific.
prosqlbody pg_node_tree
Pre-parsed SQL function body. This is used for SQL-language functions when the body
is given in SQL-standard notation rather than as a string literal. It's null in other cases.
proconfig text[]
Function's local settings for run-time configuration variables
proacl aclitem[]
```
Access privileges; see Section 5.8 for details
```
For compiled functions, both built-in and dynamically loaded, prosrc contains the function's C-lan-
```
guage name (link symbol). For SQL-language functions, prosrc contains the function's source text if
```
```
that is specified as a string literal; but if the function body is specified in SQL-standard style, prosrc
```
```
is unused (typically it's an empty string) and prosqlbody contains the pre-parsed definition. For
```
all other currently-known language types, prosrc contains the function's source text. probin is
null except for dynamically-loaded C functions, for which it gives the name of the shared library file
containing the function.

rngsubopc (plus rngcollation, if the element type is collatable) determines the sort ordering
```
used by the range type. rngcanonical is used when the element type is discrete. rngsubdiff is
optional but should be supplied to improve performance of GiST indexes on the range type.
52.44. pg_replication_origin
The pg_replication_origin catalog contains all replication origins created. For more on repli-
cation origins see Chapter 48.
2399
System Catalogs
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_replication_origin is shared across all databases of a clus-
```
ter: there is only one copy of pg_replication_origin per cluster, not one per database.
```
Table 52.44. pg_replication_origin Columns
Column Type
Description
roident oid
A unique, cluster-wide identifier for the replication origin. Should never leave the sys-
tem.
roname text
The external, user defined, name of a replication origin.

The table this rule is for
ev_type char
Event type that the rule is for: 1 = SELECT, 2 = UPDATE, 3 = INSERT, 4 = DELETE
ev_enabled char
Controls in which session_replication_role modes the rule fires. O = rule fires in “origin”
and “local” modes, D = rule is disabled, R = rule fires in “replica” mode, A = rule fires al-
ways.
is_instead bool
True if the rule is an INSTEAD rule
ev_qual pg_node_tree

Expression tree (in the form of a nodeToString() representation) for the rule's quali-
```
fying condition
ev_action pg_node_tree
```
Query tree (in the form of a nodeToString() representation) for the rule's action
```
Note
pg_class.relhasrules must be true if a table has any rules in this catalog.
52.46. pg_seclabel
The catalog pg_seclabel stores security labels on database objects. Security labels can be manip-
ulated with the SECURITY LABEL command. For an easier way to view security labels, see Sec-
tion 53.23.
2400
System Catalogs
See also pg_shseclabel, which performs a similar function for security labels of database objects
that are shared across a database cluster.
Table 52.46. pg_seclabel Columns
Column Type
Description
```
objoid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the object this security label pertains to
```
classoid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog this object appears in
objsubid int4
```
For a security label on a table column, this is the column number (the objoid and
```
```
classoid refer to the table itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
provider text
The label provider associated with this label.
label text
The security label applied to this object.
52.47. pg_sequence
The catalog pg_sequence contains information about sequences. Some of the information about
sequences, such as the name and the schema, is in pg_class
Table 52.47. pg_sequence Columns
Column Type
Description
```
seqrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the pg_class entry for this sequence
```
seqtypid oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
Data type of the sequence
seqstart int8

seqincrement int8
Increment value of the sequence
seqmax int8
Maximum value of the sequence
seqmin int8

seqcache int8
Cache size of the sequence
seqcycle bool
Whether the sequence cycles
52.48. pg_shdepend
The catalog pg_shdepend records the dependency relationships between database objects and
shared objects, such as roles. This information allows PostgreSQL to ensure that those objects are
unreferenced before attempting to delete them.
See also pg_depend, which performs a similar function for dependencies involving objects within
a single database.
2401
System Catalogs
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_shdepend is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is only
one copy of pg_shdepend per cluster, not one per database.
Table 52.48. pg_shdepend Columns
Column Type
Description
```
dbid oid (references pg_database.oid)
```
The OID of the database the dependent object is in, or zero for a shared object
```
classid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog the dependent object is in
```
objid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the specific dependent object
objsubid int4
```
For a table column, this is the column number (the objid and classid refer to the ta-
```
```
ble itself). For all other object types, this column is zero.
```
```
refclassid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
```
The OID of the system catalog the referenced object is in (must be a shared catalog)
```
```
refobjid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the specific referenced object
deptype char
```
A code defining the specific semantics of this dependency relationship; see text
```
In all cases, a pg_shdepend entry indicates that the referenced object cannot be dropped without
also dropping the dependent object. However, there are several subflavors identified by deptype:
```
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_OWNER (o)
```
```
The referenced object (which must be a role) is the owner of the dependent object.
```
```
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL (a)
```
```
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned in the ACL of the dependent object.
```
```
(A SHARED_DEPENDENCY_ACL entry is not made for the owner of the object, since the owner
```
```
will have a SHARED_DEPENDENCY_OWNER entry anyway.)
```
```
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_INITACL (i)
```
```
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned in a pg_init_privs entry for the
```
dependent object.
```
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_POLICY (r)
```
```
The referenced object (which must be a role) is mentioned as the target of a dependent policy
```
object.
```
SHARED_DEPENDENCY_TABLESPACE (t)
```
```
The referenced object (which must be a tablespace) is mentioned as the tablespace for a relation
```
that doesn't have storage.
Other dependency flavors might be needed in future. Note in particular that the current definition only
supports roles and tablespaces as referenced objects.
As in the pg_depend catalog, most objects created during initdb are considered “pinned”. No entries
are made in pg_shdepend that would have a pinned object as either referenced or dependent object.
52.49. pg_shdescription
2402
System Catalogs
```
The catalog pg_shdescription stores optional descriptions (comments) for shared database ob-
```
jects. Descriptions can be manipulated with the COMMENT command and viewed with psql's \d com-
mands.
See also pg_description, which performs a similar function for descriptions involving objects
within a single database.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_shdescription is shared across all databases of a cluster: there
is only one copy of pg_shdescription per cluster, not one per database.
Table 52.49. pg_shdescription Columns
Column Type
Description
```
objoid oid (references any OID column)
```
The OID of the object this description pertains to
```
classoid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog this object appears in
description text
Arbitrary text that serves as the description of this object
52.50. pg_shseclabel
The catalog pg_shseclabel stores security labels on shared database objects. Security labels can
be manipulated with the SECURITY LABEL command. For an easier way to view security labels,
see Section 53.23.
See also pg_seclabel, which performs a similar function for security labels involving objects
within a single database.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_shseclabel is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is
only one copy of pg_shseclabel per cluster, not one per database.
Table 52.50. pg_shseclabel Columns
Column Type
Description

The OID of the object this security label pertains to
```
classoid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The OID of the system catalog this object appears in
provider text
The label provider associated with this label.
label text
The security label applied to this object.
52.51. pg_statistic
The catalog pg_statistic stores statistical data about the contents of the database. Entries are
created by ANALYZE and subsequently used by the query planner. Note that all the statistical data is
inherently approximate, even assuming that it is up-to-date.
Normally there is one entry, with stainherit = false, for each table column that has been ana-
lyzed. If the table has inheritance children or partitions, a second entry with stainherit = true
2403
System Catalogs
is also created. This row represents the column's statistics over the inheritance tree, i.e., statistics for
the data you'd see with SELECT column FROM table*, whereas the stainherit = false
row represents the results of SELECT column FROM ONLY table.
pg_statistic also stores statistical data about the values of index expressions. These are described
```
as if they were actual data columns; in particular, starelid references the index. No entry is made
```
for an ordinary non-expression index column, however, since it would be redundant with the entry
for the underlying table column. Currently, entries for index expressions always have stainherit
= false.
Since different kinds of statistics might be appropriate for different kinds of data, pg_statistic
is designed not to assume very much about what sort of statistics it stores. Only extremely general
```
statistics (such as nullness) are given dedicated columns in pg_statistic. Everything else is stored
```
in “slots”, which are groups of associated columns whose content is identified by a code number in one
of the slot's columns. For more information see src/include/catalog/pg_statistic.h.
pg_statistic should not be readable by the public, since even statistical information about a
```
table's contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: minimum and maximum values of a salary
```
```
column might be quite interesting.) pg_stats is a publicly readable view on pg_statistic that
```
only exposes information about those tables that are readable by the current user.
Table 52.51. pg_statistic Columns
Column Type
Description
```
starelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The table or index that the described column belongs to
```
staattnum int2 (references pg_attribute.attnum)
```
The number of the described column
stainherit bool
If true, the stats include values from child tables, not just the values in the specified rela-
tion
stanullfrac float4
The fraction of the column's entries that are null
stawidth int4
The average stored width, in bytes, of nonnull entries
stadistinct float4
The number of distinct nonnull data values in the column. A value greater than zero is
the actual number of distinct values. A value less than zero is the negative of a multipli-
```
er for the number of rows in the table; for example, a column in which about 80% of the
```
values are nonnull and each nonnull value appears about twice on average could be rep-
resented by stadistinct = -0.4. A zero value means the number of distinct values is
unknown.
stakindN int2
A code number indicating the kind of statistics stored in the Nth “slot” of the pg_sta-
tistic row.
```
staopN oid (references pg_operator.oid)
```
An operator used to derive the statistics stored in the Nth “slot”. For example, a his-
togram slot would show the < operator that defines the sort order of the data. Zero if the
statistics kind does not require an operator.
```
stacollN oid (references pg_collation.oid)
```
The collation used to derive the statistics stored in the Nth “slot”. For example, a his-
togram slot for a collatable column would show the collation that defines the sort order
of the data. Zero for noncollatable data.
stanumbersN float4[]
2404
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
Numerical statistics of the appropriate kind for the Nth “slot”, or null if the slot kind does
not involve numerical values
stavaluesN anyarray
Column data values of the appropriate kind for the Nth “slot”, or null if the slot kind does
not store any data values. Each array's element values are actually of the specific col-
umn's data type, or a related type such as an array's element type, so there is no way to
define these columns' type more specifically than anyarray.
52.52. pg_statistic_ext
The catalog pg_statistic_ext holds definitions of extended planner statistics. Each row in this
catalog corresponds to a statistics object created with CREATE STATISTICS.
Table 52.52. pg_statistic_ext Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
stxrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
Table containing the columns described by this object
stxname name
Name of the statistics object
```
stxnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
```
The OID of the namespace that contains this statistics object
```
stxowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the statistics object
```
stxkeys int2vector (references pg_attribute.attnum)
```
An array of attribute numbers, indicating which table columns are covered by this sta-
```
tistics object; for example a value of 1 3 would mean that the first and the third table
```
columns are covered
stxstattarget int2
stxstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this statistics
object by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no statistics should be collected. A null
value says to use the maximum of the statistics targets of the referenced columns, if set,
or the system default statistics target. Positive values of stxstattarget determine
the target number of “most common values” to collect.
stxkind char[]
```
An array containing codes for the enabled statistics kinds; valid values are: d for n-dis-
```
```
tinct statistics, f for functional dependency statistics, m for most common values (MCV)
```
list statistics, and e for expression statistics
stxexprs pg_node_tree
```
Expression trees (in nodeToString() representation) for statistics object attributes
```
that are not simple column references. This is a list with one element per expression. Null
if all statistics object attributes are simple references.
The pg_statistic_ext entry is filled in completely during CREATE STATISTICS, but the
actual statistical values are not computed then. Subsequent ANALYZE commands compute the desired
values and populate an entry in the pg_statistic_ext_data catalog.
52.53. pg_statistic_ext_data
2405
System Catalogs
The catalog pg_statistic_ext_data holds data for extended planner statistics defined in
pg_statistic_ext. Each row in this catalog corresponds to a statistics object created with CRE-
ATE STATISTICS.
Normally there is one entry, with stxdinherit = false, for each statistics object that has been
analyzed. If the table has inheritance children or partitions, a second entry with stxdinherit =
true is also created. This row represents the statistics object over the inheritance tree, i.e., statistics
for the data you'd see with SELECT * FROM table*, whereas the stxdinherit = false row
represents the results of SELECT * FROM ONLY table.
Like pg_statistic, pg_statistic_ext_data should not be readable by the public, since the
```
contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: most common combinations of values in columns
```
```
might be quite interesting.) pg_stats_ext is a publicly readable view on pg_statistic_ex-
```
```
t_data (after joining with pg_statistic_ext) that only exposes information about tables the
```
current user owns.
Table 52.53. pg_statistic_ext_data Columns
Column Type
Description
```
stxoid oid (references pg_statistic_ext.oid)
```
Extended statistics object containing the definition for this data
stxdinherit bool
If true, the stats include values from child tables, not just the values in the specified rela-
tion
stxdndistinct pg_ndistinct
N-distinct counts, serialized as pg_ndistinct type
stxddependencies pg_dependencies
Functional dependency statistics, serialized as pg_dependencies type
stxdmcv pg_mcv_list
```
MCV (most-common values) list statistics, serialized as pg_mcv_list type
```
stxdexpr pg_statistic[]
Per-expression statistics, serialized as an array of pg_statistic type
52.54. pg_subscription
The catalog pg_subscription contains all existing logical replication subscriptions. For more
information about logical replication see Chapter 29.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_subscription is shared across all databases of a cluster: there
is only one copy of pg_subscription per cluster, not one per database.
Access to the column subconninfo is revoked from normal users, because it could contain plain-
text passwords.
Table 52.54. pg_subscription Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
subdbid oid (references pg_database.oid)
```
OID of the database that the subscription resides in

```
```
slots) in the upstream database are enabled to be synchronized to the standbys
```
subconninfo text
Connection string to the upstream database
subslotname name
```
Name of the replication slot in the upstream database (also used for the local replication
```
```
origin name); null represents NONE
```
subsynccommit text
The synchronous_commit setting for the subscription's workers to use
subpublications text[]
Array of subscribed publication names. These reference publications defined in the up-
stream database. For more on publications see Section 29.1.
suborigin text
The origin value must be either none or any. The default is any. If none, the subscrip-
tion will request the publisher to only send changes that don't have an origin. If any, the
publisher sends changes regardless of their origin.
52.55. pg_subscription_rel
The catalog pg_subscription_rel contains the state for each replicated relation in each sub-
scription. This is a many-to-many mapping.
This catalog only contains tables known to the subscription after running either CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION or ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION.

```
srsublsn pg_lsn
Remote LSN of the state change used for synchronization coordination when in s or r
states, otherwise null
52.56. pg_tablespace
The catalog pg_tablespace stores information about the available tablespaces. Tables can be
placed in particular tablespaces to aid administration of disk layout.
Unlike most system catalogs, pg_tablespace is shared across all databases of a cluster: there is
only one copy of pg_tablespace per cluster, not one per database.

Column Type
Description
```
trffromsql regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
The OID of the function to use when converting the data type for input to the procedur-
```
al language (e.g., function parameters). Zero is stored if the default behavior should be
```
used.

```
The OID of the function to use when converting output from the procedural language
```
(e.g., return values) to the data type. Zero is stored if the default behavior should be used.
```
52.58. pg_trigger
The catalog pg_trigger stores triggers on tables and views. See CREATE TRIGGER for more
information.
Table 52.58. pg_trigger Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
```
tgrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
The table this trigger is on
```
tgparentid oid (references pg_trigger.oid)
```
```
Parent trigger that this trigger is cloned from (this happens when partitions are created or
```
```
attached to a partitioned table); zero if not a clone
```
tgname name
```
Trigger name (must be unique among triggers of same table)
```
```
tgfoid oid (references pg_proc.oid)
```
The function to be called
tgtype int2
Bit mask identifying trigger firing conditions
tgenabled char
Controls in which session_replication_role modes the trigger fires. O = trigger fires in
“origin” and “local” modes, D = trigger is disabled, R = trigger fires in “replica” mode, A
= trigger fires always.
tgisinternal bool
```
True if trigger is internally generated (usually, to enforce the constraint identified by tg-
```
```
constraint)
```
```
tgconstrrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)

```
The table referenced by a referential integrity constraint (zero if trigger is not for a refer-
```
```
ential integrity constraint)
```
```
tgconstrindid oid (references pg_class.oid)

Column Type
Description
True if constraint trigger is initially deferred
tgnargs int2

tgqual pg_node_tree
```
Expression tree (in nodeToString() representation) for the trigger's WHEN condition,
```
or null if none
tgoldtable name
REFERENCING clause name for OLD TABLE, or null if none
tgnewtable name
REFERENCING clause name for NEW TABLE, or null if none
Currently, column-specific triggering is supported only for UPDATE events, and so tgattr is rele-
vant only for that event type. tgtype might contain bits for other event types as well, but those are
presumed to be table-wide regardless of what is in tgattr.
Note
When tgconstraint is nonzero, tgconstrrelid, tgconstrindid, tgde-
ferrable, and tginitdeferred are largely redundant with the referenced pg_con-
straint entry. However, it is possible for a non-deferrable trigger to be associated with
a deferrable constraint: foreign key constraints can have some deferrable and some non-de-
ferrable triggers.
Note
pg_class.relhastriggers must be true if a relation has any triggers in this catalog.
52.59. pg_ts_config
The pg_ts_config catalog contains entries representing text search configurations. A configura-
tion specifies a particular text search parser and a list of dictionaries to use for each of the parser's
output token types. The parser is shown in the pg_ts_config entry, but the token-to-dictionary
mapping is defined by subsidiary entries in pg_ts_config_map.
PostgreSQL's text search features are described at length in Chapter 12.
Table 52.59. pg_ts_config Columns

52.60. pg_ts_config_map
The pg_ts_config_map catalog contains entries showing which text search dictionaries should
be consulted, and in what order, for each output token type of each text search configuration's parser.
PostgreSQL's text search features are described at length in Chapter 12.
Table 52.60. pg_ts_config_map Columns

```
mapdict oid (references pg_ts_dict.oid)
```
The OID of the text search dictionary to consult
52.61. pg_ts_dict
The pg_ts_dict catalog contains entries defining text search dictionaries. A dictionary depends
```
on a text search template, which specifies all the implementation functions needed; the dictionary
```
itself provides values for the user-settable parameters supported by the template. This division of labor
allows dictionaries to be created by unprivileged users. The parameters are specified by a text string
dictinitoption, whose format and meaning vary depending on the template.
PostgreSQL's text search features are described at length in Chapter 12.

Initialization option string for the template
52.62. pg_ts_parser
The pg_ts_parser catalog contains entries defining text search parsers. A parser is responsible for
splitting input text into lexemes and assigning a token type to each lexeme. Since a parser must be im-
plemented by C-language-level functions, creation of new parsers is restricted to database superusers.
PostgreSQL's text search features are described at length in Chapter 12.

52.63. pg_ts_template
The pg_ts_template catalog contains entries defining text search templates. A template is the
implementation skeleton for a class of text search dictionaries. Since a template must be implemented
by C-language-level functions, creation of new templates is restricted to database superusers.
PostgreSQL's text search features are described at length in Chapter 12.

52.64. pg_type
```
The catalog pg_type stores information about data types. Base types and enum types (scalar types)
```
are created with CREATE TYPE, and domains with CREATE DOMAIN. A composite type is auto-
matically created for each table in the database, to represent the row structure of the table. It is also
possible to create composite types with CREATE TYPE AS.
Table 52.64. pg_type Columns
Column Type
Description
oid oid
Row identifier
typname name
Data type name
```
typnamespace oid (references pg_namespace.oid)
```
The OID of the namespace that contains this type
```
typowner oid (references pg_authid.oid)
```
Owner of the type
typlen int2
For a fixed-size type, typlen is the number of bytes in the internal representation of the
type. But for a variable-length type, typlen is negative. -1 indicates a “varlena” type
```
(one that has a length word), -2 indicates a null-terminated C string.
```
typbyval bool
typbyval determines whether internal routines pass a value of this type by value or by
```
reference. typbyval had better be false if typlen is not 1, 2, or 4 (or 8 on machines
```
```
where Datum is 8 bytes). Variable-length types are always passed by reference. Note that
```
typbyval can be false even if the length would allow pass-by-value.
typtype char
```
typtype is b for a base type, c for a composite type (e.g., a table's row type), d for a
```
domain, e for an enum type, p for a pseudo-type, r for a range type, or m for a multi-
range type. See also typrelid and typbasetype.
typcategory char
typcategory is an arbitrary classification of data types that is used by the parser to
determine which implicit casts should be “preferred”. See Table 52.65.
typispreferred bool
True if the type is a preferred cast target within its typcategory
typisdefined bool
True if the type is defined, false if this is a placeholder entry for a not-yet-defined type.
When typisdefined is false, nothing except the type name, namespace, and OID can
be relied on.
typdelim char
Character that separates two values of this type when parsing array input. Note that the
delimiter is associated with the array element data type, not the array data type.
```
typrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)
```
```
If this is a composite type (see typtype), then this column points to the pg_class
```
```
entry that defines the corresponding table. (For a free-standing composite type, the
```

System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
pg_class entry doesn't really represent a table, but it is needed anyway for the type's
```
pg_attribute entries to link to.) Zero for non-composite types.
```
```
typsubscript regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
Subscripting handler function's OID, or zero if this type doesn't support subscripting.
Types that are “true” array types have typsubscript = array_subscript_han-
dler, but other types may have other handler functions to implement specialized sub-
scripting behavior.
```
typelem oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
If typelem is not zero then it identifies another row in pg_type, defining the type
yielded by subscripting. This should be zero if typsubscript is zero. However, it can
be zero when typsubscript isn't zero, if the handler doesn't need typelem to de-
termine the subscripting result type. Note that a typelem dependency is considered to
```
imply physical containment of the element type in this type; so DDL changes on the ele-
```
ment type might be restricted by the presence of this type.
```
typarray oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
If typarray is not zero then it identifies another row in pg_type, which is the “true”
array type having this type as element
```
typinput regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
```
Input conversion function (text format)
```
```
typoutput regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
```
Output conversion function (text format)
```
```
typreceive regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
```
Input conversion function (binary format), or zero if none
```
```
typsend regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
```
Output conversion function (binary format), or zero if none
```
```
typmodin regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
Type modifier input function, or zero if type does not support modifiers
```
typmodout regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
Type modifier output function, or zero to use the standard format
```
typanalyze regproc (references pg_proc.oid)
```
Custom ANALYZE function, or zero to use the standard function
typalign char
typalign is the alignment required when storing a value of this type. It applies to stor-
age on disk as well as most representations of the value inside PostgreSQL. When mul-
tiple values are stored consecutively, such as in the representation of a complete row on
disk, padding is inserted before a datum of this type so that it begins on the specified
boundary. The alignment reference is the beginning of the first datum in the sequence.
Possible values are:
• c = char alignment, i.e., no alignment needed.
```
• s = short alignment (2 bytes on most machines).
```
```
• i = int alignment (4 bytes on most machines).
```
```
• d = double alignment (8 bytes on many machines, but by no means all).
```
typstorage char
```
typstorage tells for varlena types (those with typlen = -1) if the type is prepared
```
for toasting and what the default strategy for attributes of this type should be. Possible
values are:
2414
System Catalogs
Column Type
Description
```
• p (plain): Values must always be stored plain (non-varlena types always use this val-
```
```
ue).
```
```
• e (external): Values can be stored in a secondary “TOAST” relation (if relation has
```
```
one, see pg_class.reltoastrelid).
```
```
• m (main): Values can be compressed and stored inline.
```
```
• x (extended): Values can be compressed and/or moved to a secondary relation.
```
x is the usual choice for toast-able types. Note that m values can also be moved out to
```
secondary storage, but only as a last resort (e and x values are moved first).
```
typnotnull bool
typnotnull represents a not-null constraint on a type. Used for domains only.
```
typbasetype oid (references pg_type.oid)
```
```
If this is a domain (see typtype), then typbasetype identifies the type that this one
```
is based on. Zero if this type is not a domain.
typtypmod int4
```
Domains use typtypmod to record the typmod to be applied to their base type (-1 if
```
```
base type does not use a typmod). -1 if this type is not a domain.
```
typndims int4
```
typndims is the number of array dimensions for a domain over an array (that is, typ-
```
```
basetype is an array type). Zero for types other than domains over array types.
```
```
typcollation oid (references pg_collation.oid)
```
typcollation specifies the collation of the type. If the type does not support colla-
tions, this will be zero. A base type that supports collations will have a nonzero value
here, typically DEFAULT_COLLATION_OID. A domain over a collatable type can have
a collation OID different from its base type's, if one was specified for the domain.
typdefaultbin pg_node_tree
```
If typdefaultbin is not null, it is the nodeToString() representation of a default
```
expression for the type. This is only used for domains.
typdefault text
typdefault is null if the type has no associated default value. If typdefaultbin is
not null, typdefault must contain a human-readable version of the default expression
represented by typdefaultbin. If typdefaultbin is null and typdefault is
not, then typdefault is the external representation of the type's default value, which
can be fed to the type's input converter to produce a constant.

Note
For fixed-width types used in system tables, it is critical that the size and alignment defined
in pg_type agree with the way that the compiler will lay out the column in a structure rep-
resenting a table row.
Table 52.65 lists the system-defined values of typcategory. Any future additions to this list will
also be upper-case ASCII letters. All other ASCII characters are reserved for user-defined categories.
