Chapter 32. libpq — C Library
libpq is the C application programmer's interface to PostgreSQL. libpq is a set of library functions
that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL backend server and to receive the results
of these queries.
libpq is also the underlying engine for several other PostgreSQL application interfaces, including those
written for C++, Perl, Python, Tcl and ECPG. So some aspects of libpq's behavior will be important
to you if you use one of those packages. In particular, Section 32.15, Section 32.16 and Section 32.19
describe behavior that is visible to the user of any application that uses libpq.
```
Some short programs are included at the end of this chapter (Section 32.23) to show how to write
```
programs that use libpq. There are also several complete examples of libpq applications in the directory
src/test/examples in the source code distribution.
Client programs that use libpq must include the header file libpq-fe.h and must link with the
libpq library.
32.1. Database Connection Control Functions
The following functions deal with making a connection to a PostgreSQL backend server. An applica-
```
tion program can have several backend connections open at one time. (One reason to do that is to ac-
```
```
cess more than one database.) Each connection is represented by a PGconn object, which is obtained
```
from the function PQconnectdb, PQconnectdbParams, or PQsetdbLogin. Note that these
functions will always return a non-null object pointer, unless perhaps there is too little memory even
to allocate the PGconn object. The PQstatus function should be called to check the return value
for a successful connection before queries are sent via the connection object.
Warning
If untrusted users have access to a database that has not adopted a secure schema usage pattern,
begin each session by removing publicly-writable schemas from search_path. One can
set parameter key word options to value -csearch_path=. Alternately, one can issue
```
PQexec(conn, "SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '',
```
```
false)") after connecting. This consideration is not specific to libpq; it applies to every
```
interface for executing arbitrary SQL commands.
Warning
On Unix, forking a process with open libpq connections can lead to unpredictable results be-
cause the parent and child processes share the same sockets and operating system resources.
For this reason, such usage is not recommended, though doing an exec from the child process
to load a new executable is safe.
PQconnectdbParams
Makes a new connection to the database server.
```
PGconn *PQconnectdbParams(const char * const *keywords,
```
const char * const *values,
```
int expand_dbname);
```
960
libpq — C Library
This function opens a new database connection using the parameters taken from two NULL-ter-
minated arrays. The first, keywords, is defined as an array of strings, each one being a key
word. The second, values, gives the value for each key word. Unlike PQsetdbLogin below,
the parameter set can be extended without changing the function signature, so use of this function
```
(or its nonblocking analogs PQconnectStartParams and PQconnectPoll) is preferred
```
for new application programming.
The currently recognized parameter key words are listed in Section 32.1.2.
The passed arrays can be empty to use all default parameters, or can contain one or more parameter
settings. They must be matched in length. Processing will stop at the first NULL entry in the
keywords array. Also, if the values entry associated with a non-NULL keywords entry is
NULL or an empty string, that entry is ignored and processing continues with the next pair of
array entries.
When expand_dbname is non-zero, the value for the first dbname key word is checked to see if
it is a connection string. If so, it is “expanded” into the individual connection parameters extracted
from the string. The value is considered to be a connection string, rather than just a database
```
name, if it contains an equal sign (=) or it begins with a URI scheme designator. (More details
```
```
on connection string formats appear in Section 32.1.1.) Only the first occurrence of dbname is
```
```
treated in this way; any subsequent dbname parameter is processed as a plain database name.
```
In general the parameter arrays are processed from start to end. If any key word is repeated,
```
the last value (that is not NULL or empty) is used. This rule applies in particular when a key
```
word found in a connection string conflicts with one appearing in the keywords array. Thus,
the programmer may determine whether array entries can override or be overridden by values
taken from a connection string. Array entries appearing before an expanded dbname entry can
be overridden by fields of the connection string, and in turn those fields are overridden by array
```
entries appearing after dbname (but, again, only if those entries supply non-empty values).
```
After processing all the array entries and any expanded connection string, any connection para-
meters that remain unset are filled with default values. If an unset parameter's corresponding en-
```
vironment variable (see Section 32.15) is set, its value is used. If the environment variable is not
```
set either, then the parameter's built-in default value is used.
PQconnectdb
Makes a new connection to the database server.
```
PGconn *PQconnectdb(const char *conninfo);
```
This function opens a new database connection using the parameters taken from the string con-
ninfo.
The passed string can be empty to use all default parameters, or it can contain one or more para-
meter settings separated by whitespace, or it can contain a URI. See Section 32.1.1 for details.
PQsetdbLogin
Makes a new connection to the database server.
```
PGconn *PQsetdbLogin(const char *pghost,
```
const char *pgport,
const char *pgoptions,
const char *pgtty,
const char *dbName,
const char *login,
961
libpq — C Library
```
const char *pwd);
```
This is the predecessor of PQconnectdb with a fixed set of parameters. It has the same func-
tionality except that the missing parameters will always take on default values. Write NULL or an
empty string for any one of the fixed parameters that is to be defaulted.
If the dbName contains an = sign or has a valid connection URI prefix, it is taken as a conninfo
string in exactly the same way as if it had been passed to PQconnectdb, and the remaining
parameters are then applied as specified for PQconnectdbParams.
pgtty is no longer used and any value passed will be ignored.
PQsetdb
Makes a new connection to the database server.
```
PGconn *PQsetdb(char *pghost,
```
char *pgport,
char *pgoptions,
char *pgtty,
```
char *dbName);
```
This is a macro that calls PQsetdbLogin with null pointers for the login and pwd parameters.
It is provided for backward compatibility with very old programs.
PQconnectStartParams
PQconnectStart
PQconnectPoll
Make a connection to the database server in a nonblocking manner.
```
PGconn *PQconnectStartParams(const char * const *keywords,
```
const char * const *values,
```
int expand_dbname);
```
```
PGconn *PQconnectStart(const char *conninfo);
```
```
PostgresPollingStatusType PQconnectPoll(PGconn *conn);
```
These three functions are used to open a connection to a database server such that your applica-
tion's thread of execution is not blocked on remote I/O whilst doing so. The point of this approach
is that the waits for I/O to complete can occur in the application's main loop, rather than down
inside PQconnectdbParams or PQconnectdb, and so the application can manage this op-
eration in parallel with other activities.
With PQconnectStartParams, the database connection is made using the parameters taken
from the keywords and values arrays, and controlled by expand_dbname, as described
above for PQconnectdbParams.
With PQconnectStart, the database connection is made using the parameters taken from the
string conninfo as described above for PQconnectdb.
Neither PQconnectStartParams nor PQconnectStart nor PQconnectPoll will
block, so long as a number of restrictions are met:
• The hostaddr parameter must be used appropriately to prevent DNS queries from being
made. See the documentation of this parameter in Section 32.1.2 for details.
962
libpq — C Library
• If you call PQtrace, ensure that the stream object into which you trace will not block.
• You must ensure that the socket is in the appropriate state before calling PQconnectPoll,
as described below.
To begin a nonblocking connection request, call PQconnectStart or PQconnectStart-
Params. If the result is null, then libpq has been unable to allocate a new PGconn structure.
```
Otherwise, a valid PGconn pointer is returned (though not yet representing a valid connection to
```
```
the database). Next call PQstatus(conn). If the result is CONNECTION_BAD, the connection
```
attempt has already failed, typically because of invalid connection parameters.
If PQconnectStart or PQconnectStartParams succeeds, the next stage is to poll libpq
```
so that it can proceed with the connection sequence. Use PQsocket(conn) to obtain the de-
```
```
scriptor of the socket underlying the database connection. (Caution: do not assume that the socket
```
```
remains the same across PQconnectPoll calls.) Loop thus: If PQconnectPoll(conn) last
```
```
returned PGRES_POLLING_READING, wait until the socket is ready to read (as indicated by
```
```
select(), poll(), or similar system function). Note that PQsocketPoll can help reduce
```
```
boilerplate by abstracting the setup of select(2) or poll(2) if it is available on your system.
```
```
Then call PQconnectPoll(conn) again. Conversely, if PQconnectPoll(conn) last re-
```
turned PGRES_POLLING_WRITING, wait until the socket is ready to write, then call PQcon-
```
nectPoll(conn) again. On the first iteration, i.e., if you have yet to call PQconnectPoll,
```
behave as if it last returned PGRES_POLLING_WRITING. Continue this loop until PQcon-
```
nectPoll(conn) returns PGRES_POLLING_FAILED, indicating the connection procedure
```
has failed, or PGRES_POLLING_OK, indicating the connection has been successfully made.
At any time during connection, the status of the connection can be checked by calling PQsta-
```
tus. If this call returns CONNECTION_BAD, then the connection procedure has failed; if the
```
call returns CONNECTION_OK, then the connection is ready. Both of these states are equally
detectable from the return value of PQconnectPoll, described above. Other states might also
```
occur during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure. These indicate the current
```
stage of the connection procedure and might be useful to provide feedback to the user for exam-
ple. These statuses are:
CONNECTION_STARTED
Waiting for connection to be made.
CONNECTION_MADE
```
Connection OK; waiting to send.
```
CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE
Waiting for a response from the server.
CONNECTION_AUTH_OK
```
Received authentication; waiting for backend start-up to finish.
```
CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP
Negotiating SSL encryption.
CONNECTION_GSS_STARTUP
Negotiating GSS encryption.
CONNECTION_CHECK_WRITABLE
Checking if connection is able to handle write transactions.
963
libpq — C Library
CONNECTION_CHECK_STANDBY
Checking if connection is to a server in standby mode.
CONNECTION_CONSUME
Consuming any remaining response messages on connection.
```
Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain compatibility), an application
```
should never rely upon these occurring in a particular order, or at all, or on the status always being
one of these documented values. An application might do something like this:
```
switch(PQstatus(conn))
```
```
{
```
case CONNECTION_STARTED:
```
feedback = "Connecting...";
```
```
break;
```
case CONNECTION_MADE:
```
feedback = "Connected to server...";
```
```
break;
```
.
.
.
```
default:
```
```
feedback = "Connecting...";
```
```
}
```
```
The connect_timeout connection parameter is ignored when using PQconnectPoll; it
```
is the application's responsibility to decide whether an excessive amount of time has elapsed.
Otherwise, PQconnectStart followed by a PQconnectPoll loop is equivalent to PQcon-
nectdb.
Note that when PQconnectStart or PQconnectStartParams returns a non-null pointer,
you must call PQfinish when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of the structure and any
associated memory blocks. This must be done even if the connection attempt fails or is abandoned.
PQsocketPoll
Poll a connection's underlying socket descriptor retrieved with PQsocket. The primary use
of this function is iterating through the connection sequence described in the documentation of
PQconnectStartParams.
```
typedef int64_t pg_usec_time_t;
```
```
int PQsocketPoll(int sock, int forRead, int forWrite,
```
```
pg_usec_time_t end_time);
```
This function performs polling of a file descriptor, optionally with a timeout. If forRead is
nonzero, the function will terminate when the socket is ready for reading. If forWrite is nonze-
ro, the function will terminate when the socket is ready for writing.
The timeout is specified by end_time, which is the time to stop waiting expressed as a number
```
of microseconds since the Unix epoch (that is, time_t times 1 million). Timeout is infinite if
```
```
end_time is -1. Timeout is immediate (no blocking) if end_time is 0 (or indeed, any time
```
```
before now). Timeout values can be calculated conveniently by adding the desired number of
```
microseconds to the result of PQgetCurrentTimeUSec. Note that the underlying system calls
may have less than microsecond precision, so that the actual delay may be imprecise.
964
libpq — C Library
The function returns a value greater than 0 if the specified condition is met, 0 if a timeout occurred,
```
or -1 if an error occurred. The error can be retrieved by checking the errno(3) value. In
```
the event both forRead and forWrite are zero, the function immediately returns a timeout
indication.
```
PQsocketPoll is implemented using either poll(2) or select(2), depending on plat-
```
```
form. See POLLIN and POLLOUT from poll(2), or readfds and writefds from se-
```
```
lect(2), for more information.
```
PQconndefaults
Returns the default connection options.
```
PQconninfoOption *PQconndefaults(void);
```
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
char *keyword; /* The keyword of the option */
```
```
char *envvar; /* Fallback environment variable name */
```
```
char *compiled; /* Fallback compiled in default value */
```
```
char *val; /* Option's current value, or NULL */
```
```
char *label; /* Label for field in connect dialog */
```
```
char *dispchar; /* Indicates how to display this field
```
in a connect dialog. Values are:
"" Display entered value as is
"*" Password field - hide value
"D" Debug option - don't show by
default */
```
int dispsize; /* Field size in characters for dialog */
```
```
} PQconninfoOption;
```
Returns a connection options array. This can be used to determine all possible PQconnectdb
options and their current default values. The return value points to an array of PQconninfoOp-
tion structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer. The null pointer
```
is returned if memory could not be allocated. Note that the current default values (val fields)
```
will depend on environment variables and other context. A missing or invalid service file will be
silently ignored. Callers must treat the connection options data as read-only.
After processing the options array, free it by passing it to PQconninfoFree. If this is not done,
a small amount of memory is leaked for each call to PQconndefaults.
PQconninfo
Returns the connection options used by a live connection.
```
PQconninfoOption *PQconninfo(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns a connection options array. This can be used to determine all possible PQconnectdb
options and the values that were used to connect to the server. The return value points to an array
of PQconninfoOption structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer.
All notes above for PQconndefaults also apply to the result of PQconninfo.
PQconninfoParse
Returns parsed connection options from the provided connection string.
965
libpq — C Library
```
PQconninfoOption *PQconninfoParse(const char *conninfo, char
```
```
**errmsg);
```
```
Parses a connection string and returns the resulting options as an array; or returns NULL if there
```
is a problem with the connection string. This function can be used to extract the PQconnectdb
options in the provided connection string. The return value points to an array of PQconnin-
foOption structures, which ends with an entry having a null keyword pointer.
All legal options will be present in the result array, but the PQconninfoOption for any option
```
not present in the connection string will have val set to NULL; default values are not inserted.
```
If errmsg is not NULL, then *errmsg is set to NULL on success, else to a malloc'd error
```
string explaining the problem. (It is also possible for *errmsg to be set to NULL and the function
```
```
to return NULL; this indicates an out-of-memory condition.)
```
After processing the options array, free it by passing it to PQconninfoFree. If this is not done,
some memory is leaked for each call to PQconninfoParse. Conversely, if an error occurs and
errmsg is not NULL, be sure to free the error string using PQfreemem.
PQfinish
Closes the connection to the server. Also frees memory used by the PGconn object.
```
void PQfinish(PGconn *conn);
```
```
Note that even if the server connection attempt fails (as indicated by PQstatus), the application
```
should call PQfinish to free the memory used by the PGconn object. The PGconn pointer
must not be used again after PQfinish has been called.
PQreset
Resets the communication channel to the server.
```
void PQreset(PGconn *conn);
```
This function will close the connection to the server and attempt to establish a new connection,
using all the same parameters previously used. This might be useful for error recovery if a working
connection is lost.
PQresetStart
PQresetPoll
Reset the communication channel to the server, in a nonblocking manner.
```
int PQresetStart(PGconn *conn);
```
```
PostgresPollingStatusType PQresetPoll(PGconn *conn);
```
These functions will close the connection to the server and attempt to establish a new connection,
using all the same parameters previously used. This can be useful for error recovery if a working
```
connection is lost. They differ from PQreset (above) in that they act in a nonblocking manner.
```
These functions suffer from the same restrictions as PQconnectStartParams, PQconnec-
tStart and PQconnectPoll.
To initiate a connection reset, call PQresetStart. If it returns 0, the reset has failed. If it
returns 1, poll the reset using PQresetPoll in exactly the same way as you would create the
connection using PQconnectPoll.
966
libpq — C Library
PQpingParams
PQpingParams reports the status of the server. It accepts connection parameters identical to
those of PQconnectdbParams, described above. It is not necessary to supply correct user
```
name, password, or database name values to obtain the server status; however, if incorrect values
```
are provided, the server will log a failed connection attempt.
```
PGPing PQpingParams(const char * const *keywords,
```
const char * const *values,
```
int expand_dbname);
```
The function returns one of the following values:
PQPING_OK
The server is running and appears to be accepting connections.
PQPING_REJECT
```
The server is running but is in a state that disallows connections (startup, shutdown, or crash
```
```
recovery).
```
PQPING_NO_RESPONSE
The server could not be contacted. This might indicate that the server is not running, or that
```
there is something wrong with the given connection parameters (for example, wrong port
```
```
number), or that there is a network connectivity problem (for example, a firewall blocking
```
```
the connection request).
```
PQPING_NO_ATTEMPT
No attempt was made to contact the server, because the supplied parameters were obviously
```
incorrect or there was some client-side problem (for example, out of memory).
```
PQping
PQping reports the status of the server. It accepts connection parameters identical to those of
PQconnectdb, described above. It is not necessary to supply correct user name, password, or
```
database name values to obtain the server status; however, if incorrect values are provided, the
```
server will log a failed connection attempt.
```
PGPing PQping(const char *conninfo);
```
The return values are the same as for PQpingParams.
PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL
PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL lets an application override libpq's default handling of
encrypted client certificate key files using sslpassword or interactive prompting.
```
void PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL(PQsslKeyPassHook_OpenSSL_type
```
```
hook);
```
The application passes a pointer to a callback function with signature:
```
int callback_fn(char *buf, int size, PGconn *conn);
```
967
libpq — C Library
which libpq will then call instead of its default PQdefaultSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL
handler. The callback should determine the password for the key and copy it to result-buffer buf
of size size. The string in buf must be null-terminated. The callback must return the length
of the password stored in buf excluding the null terminator. On failure, the callback should set
buf[0] = '\0' and return 0. See PQdefaultSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL in libpq's
source code for an example.
If the user specified an explicit key location, its path will be in conn->sslkey when the call-
back is invoked. This will be empty if the default key path is being used. For keys that are engine
specifiers, it is up to engine implementations whether they use the OpenSSL password callback
or define their own handling.
The app callback may choose to delegate unhandled cases to PQdefaultSSLKey-
PassHook_OpenSSL, or call it first and try something else if it returns 0, or completely over-
ride it.
```
The callback must not escape normal flow control with exceptions, longjmp(...), etc. It must
```
return normally.
PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL
PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL returns the current client certificate key password hook,
or NULL if none has been set.
```
PQsslKeyPassHook_OpenSSL_type PQgetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL(void);
```
32.1.1. Connection Strings
Several libpq functions parse a user-specified string to obtain connection parameters. There are two
accepted formats for these strings: plain keyword/value strings and URIs. URIs generally follow RFC
39861, except that multi-host connection strings are allowed as further described below.
32.1.1.1. Keyword/Value Connection Strings
```
In the keyword/value format, each parameter setting is in the form keyword = value, with space(s)
```
between settings. Spaces around a setting's equal sign are optional. To write an empty value, or a value
containing spaces, surround it with single quotes, for example keyword = 'a value'. Single
quotes and backslashes within a value must be escaped with a backslash, i.e., \' and \\.
```
Example:
```
```
host=localhost port=5432 dbname=mydb connect_timeout=10
```
The recognized parameter key words are listed in Section 32.1.2.
32.1.1.2. Connection URIs
The general form for a connection URI is:
```
postgresql://[userspec@][hostspec][/dbname][?paramspec]
```
where userspec is:
1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986
968
libpq — C Library
user[:password]
and hostspec is:
[host][:port][,...]
and paramspec is:
```
name=value[&...]
```
The URI scheme designator can be either postgresql:// or postgres://. Each of the remain-
ing URI parts is optional. The following examples illustrate valid URI syntax:
```
postgresql://
```
```
postgresql://localhost
```
```
postgresql://localhost:5433
```
```
postgresql://localhost/mydb
```
```
postgresql://user@localhost
```
```
postgresql://user:secret@localhost
```
```
postgresql://other@localhost/otherdb?
```
```
connect_timeout=10&application_name=myapp
```
```
postgresql://host1:123,host2:456/somedb?
```
```
target_session_attrs=any&application_name=myapp
```
Values that would normally appear in the hierarchical part of the URI can alternatively be given as
named parameters. For example:
```
postgresql:///mydb?host=localhost&port=5433
```
All named parameters must match key words listed in Section 32.1.2, except that for compatibility
with JDBC connection URIs, instances of ssl=true are translated into sslmode=require.
The connection URI needs to be encoded with percent-encoding2 if it includes symbols with special
```
meaning in any of its parts. Here is an example where the equal sign (=) is replaced with %3D and
```
the space character with %20:
```
postgresql://user@localhost:5433/mydb?options=-c
```
%20synchronous_commit%3Doff
The host part may be either a host name or an IP address. To specify an IPv6 address, enclose it in
square brackets:
```
postgresql://[2001:db8::1234]/database
```
The host part is interpreted as described for the parameter host. In particular, a Unix-domain socket
connection is chosen if the host part is either empty or looks like an absolute path name, otherwise a
TCP/IP connection is initiated. Note, however, that the slash is a reserved character in the hierarchical
part of the URI. So, to specify a non-standard Unix-domain socket directory, either omit the host part
of the URI and specify the host as a named parameter, or percent-encode the path in the host part of
the URI:
```
postgresql:///dbname?host=/var/lib/postgresql
```
```
postgresql://%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fpostgresql/dbname
```
2 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1
969
libpq — C Library
It is possible to specify multiple host components, each with an optional port component, in a sin-
gle URI. A URI of the form postgresql://host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/
is equivalent to a connection string of the form host=host1,host2,host3
```
port=port1,port2,port3. As further described below, each host will be tried in turn until a
```
connection is successfully established.
32.1.1.3. Specifying Multiple Hosts
It is possible to specify multiple hosts to connect to, so that they are tried in the given order. In the
Keyword/Value format, the host, hostaddr, and port options accept comma-separated lists of
values. The same number of elements must be given in each option that is specified, such that e.g., the
first hostaddr corresponds to the first host name, the second hostaddr corresponds to the second
host name, and so forth. As an exception, if only one port is specified, it applies to all the hosts.
In the connection URI format, you can list multiple host:port pairs separated by commas in the
host component of the URI.
In either format, a single host name can translate to multiple network addresses. A common example
of this is a host that has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address.
When multiple hosts are specified, or when a single host name is translated to multiple addresses, all
the hosts and addresses will be tried in order, until one succeeds. If none of the hosts can be reached,
the connection fails. If a connection is established successfully, but authentication fails, the remaining
hosts in the list are not tried.
If a password file is used, you can have different passwords for different hosts. All the other connection
```
options are the same for every host in the list; it is not possible to e.g., specify different usernames
```
for different hosts.
32.1.2. Parameter Key Words
The currently recognized parameter key words are:
host
Name of host to connect to. If a host name looks like an absolute path name, it specifies Unix-
```
domain communication rather than TCP/IP communication; the value is the name of the directo-
```
```
ry in which the socket file is stored. (On Unix, an absolute path name begins with a slash. On
```
```
Windows, paths starting with drive letters are also recognized.) If the host name starts with @, it
```
```
is taken as a Unix-domain socket in the abstract namespace (currently supported on Linux and
```
```
Windows). The default behavior when host is not specified, or is empty, is to connect to a Unix-
```
```
domain socket in /tmp (or whatever socket directory was specified when PostgreSQL was built).
```
On Windows, the default is to connect to localhost.
A comma-separated list of host names is also accepted, in which case each host name in the list
```
is tried in order; an empty item in the list selects the default behavior as explained above. See
```
Section 32.1.1.3 for details.
hostaddr
Numeric IP address of host to connect to. This should be in the standard IPv4 address format,
e.g., 172.28.40.9. If your machine supports IPv6, you can also use those addresses. TCP/
IP communication is always used when a nonempty string is specified for this parameter. If this
parameter is not specified, the value of host will be looked up to find the corresponding IP
address — or, if host specifies an IP address, that value will be used directly.
Using hostaddr allows the application to avoid a host name look-up, which might be important
in applications with time constraints. However, a host name is required for GSSAPI or SSPI
970
libpq — C Library
authentication methods, as well as for verify-full SSL certificate verification. The following
rules are used:
```
• If host is specified without hostaddr, a host name lookup occurs. (When using PQcon-
```
nectPoll, the lookup occurs when PQconnectPoll first considers this host name, and it
```
may cause PQconnectPoll to block for a significant amount of time.)
```
• If hostaddr is specified without host, the value for hostaddr gives the server network
address. The connection attempt will fail if the authentication method requires a host name.
• If both host and hostaddr are specified, the value for hostaddr gives the server network
address. The value for host is ignored unless the authentication method requires it, in which
case it will be used as the host name.
Note that authentication is likely to fail if host is not the name of the server at network address
hostaddr. Also, when both host and hostaddr are specified, host is used to identify the
```
connection in a password file (see Section 32.16).
```
A comma-separated list of hostaddr values is also accepted, in which case each host in the list
is tried in order. An empty item in the list causes the corresponding host name to be used, or the
default host name if that is empty as well. See Section 32.1.1.3 for details.
```
Without either a host name or host address, libpq will connect using a local Unix-domain socket;
```
or on Windows, it will attempt to connect to localhost.
port
Port number to connect to at the server host, or socket file name extension for Unix-domain con-
nections. If multiple hosts were given in the host or hostaddr parameters, this parameter may
specify a comma-separated list of ports of the same length as the host list, or it may specify a sin-
gle port number to be used for all hosts. An empty string, or an empty item in a comma-separated
list, specifies the default port number established when PostgreSQL was built.
dbname
The database name. Defaults to be the same as the user name. In certain contexts, the value is
```
checked for extended formats; see Section 32.1.1 for more details on those.
```
user
PostgreSQL user name to connect as. Defaults to be the same as the operating system name of
the user running the application.
password
Password to be used if the server demands password authentication.
passfile
```
Specifies the name of the file used to store passwords (see Section 32.16). Defaults to ~/.pg-
```
```
pass, or %APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf on Microsoft Windows. (No error is
```
```
reported if this file does not exist.)
```
require_auth
Specifies the authentication method that the client requires from the server. If the server does not
use the required method to authenticate the client, or if the authentication handshake is not fully
completed by the server, the connection will fail. A comma-separated list of methods may also
be provided, of which the server must use exactly one in order for the connection to succeed.
By default, any authentication method is accepted, and the server is free to skip authentication
altogether.
971
libpq — C Library
Methods may be negated with the addition of a ! prefix, in which case the server must not attempt
```
the listed method; any other method is accepted, and the server is free not to authenticate the client
```
at all. If a comma-separated list is provided, the server may not attempt any of the listed negated
methods. Negated and non-negated forms may not be combined in the same setting.
As a final special case, the none method requires the server not to use an authentication challenge.
```
(It may also be negated, to require some form of authentication.)
```
The following methods may be specified:
password
The server must request plaintext password authentication.
md5
The server must request MD5 hashed password authentication.
Warning
Support for MD5-encrypted passwords is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release of PostgreSQL. Refer to Section 20.5 for details about migrating to another
password type.
gss
The server must either request a Kerberos handshake via GSSAPI or establish a GSS-en-
```
crypted channel (see also gssencmode).
```
sspi
The server must request Windows SSPI authentication.
scram-sha-256
The server must successfully complete a SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication exchange with
the client.
oauth
The server must request an OAuth bearer token from the client.
none
```
The server must not prompt the client for an authentication exchange. (This does not prohibit
```
```
client certificate authentication via TLS, nor GSS authentication via its encrypted transport.)
```
channel_binding
This option controls the client's use of channel binding. A setting of require means that the
connection must employ channel binding, prefer means that the client will choose channel
binding if available, and disable prevents the use of channel binding. The default is prefer
```
if PostgreSQL is compiled with SSL support; otherwise the default is disable.
```
Channel binding is a method for the server to authenticate itself to the client. It is only support-
ed over SSL connections with PostgreSQL 11 or later servers using the SCRAM authentication
method.
972
libpq — C Library
connect_timeout
```
Maximum time to wait while connecting, in seconds (write as a decimal integer, e.g., 10). Zero,
```
negative, or not specified means wait indefinitely. This timeout applies separately to each host
name or IP address. For example, if you specify two hosts and connect_timeout is 5, each
host will time out if no connection is made within 5 seconds, so the total time spent waiting for
a connection might be up to 10 seconds.
client_encoding
This sets the client_encoding configuration parameter for this connection. In addition to the
values accepted by the corresponding server option, you can use auto to determine the right en-
```
coding from the current locale in the client (LC_CTYPE environment variable on Unix systems).
```
options
Specifies command-line options to send to the server at connection start. For example, setting
this to -c geqo=off or --geqo=off sets the session's value of the geqo parameter to off.
Spaces within this string are considered to separate command-line arguments, unless escaped with
```
a backslash (\); write \\ to represent a literal backslash. For a detailed discussion of the available
```
options, consult Chapter 19.
application_name
Specifies a value for the application_name configuration parameter.
fallback_application_name
Specifies a fallback value for the application_name configuration parameter. This value will be
used if no value has been given for application_name via a connection parameter or the
PGAPPNAME environment variable. Specifying a fallback name is useful in generic utility pro-
grams that wish to set a default application name but allow it to be overridden by the user.
keepalives
Controls whether client-side TCP keepalives are used. The default value is 1, meaning on, but
you can change this to 0, meaning off, if keepalives are not wanted. This parameter is ignored for
connections made via a Unix-domain socket.
keepalives_idle
Controls the number of seconds of inactivity after which TCP should send a keepalive message
to the server. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for connections
made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only supported on systems
```
where TCP_KEEPIDLE or an equivalent socket option is available, and on Windows; on other
```
systems, it has no effect.
keepalives_interval
Controls the number of seconds after which a TCP keepalive message that is not acknowledged
by the server should be retransmitted. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is
ignored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only
supported on systems where TCP_KEEPINTVL or an equivalent socket option is available, and
```
on Windows; on other systems, it has no effect.
```
keepalives_count
Controls the number of TCP keepalives that can be lost before the client's connection to the server
is considered dead. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ignored for con-
nections made via a Unix-domain socket, or if keepalives are disabled. It is only supported on
```
systems where TCP_KEEPCNT or an equivalent socket option is available; on other systems, it
```
has no effect.
973
libpq — C Library
tcp_user_timeout
Controls the number of milliseconds that transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before
a connection is forcibly closed. A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter is ig-
nored for connections made via a Unix-domain socket. It is only supported on systems where
```
TCP_USER_TIMEOUT is available; on other systems, it has no effect.
```
replication
This option determines whether the connection should use the replication protocol instead of
the normal protocol. This is what PostgreSQL replication connections as well as tools such as
pg_basebackup use internally, but it can also be used by third-party applications. For a description
of the replication protocol, consult Section 54.4.
The following values, which are case-insensitive, are supported:
true, on, yes, 1
The connection goes into physical replication mode.
database
The connection goes into logical replication mode, connecting to the database specified in
the dbname parameter.
false, off, no, 0
The connection is a regular one, which is the default behavior.
In physical or logical replication mode, only the simple query protocol can be used.
gssencmode
This option determines whether or with what priority a secure GSS TCP/IP connection will be
negotiated with the server. There are three modes:
disable
only try a non-GSSAPI-encrypted connection
```
prefer (default)
```
```
if there are GSSAPI credentials present (i.e., in a credentials cache), first try a GSSAPI-
```
```
encrypted connection; if that fails or there are no credentials, try a non-GSSAPI-encrypted
```
connection. This is the default when PostgreSQL has been compiled with GSSAPI support.
require
only try a GSSAPI-encrypted connection
gssencmode is ignored for Unix domain socket communication. If PostgreSQL is compiled
without GSSAPI support, using the require option will cause an error, while prefer will be
accepted but libpq will not actually attempt a GSSAPI-encrypted connection.
sslmode
This option determines whether or with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be
negotiated with the server. There are six modes:
disable
only try a non-SSL connection
974
libpq — C Library
allow
```
first try a non-SSL connection; if that fails, try an SSL connection
```
```
prefer (default)
```
```
first try an SSL connection; if that fails, try a non-SSL connection
```
require
only try an SSL connection. If a root CA file is present, verify the certificate in the same way
as if verify-ca was specified
verify-ca
only try an SSL connection, and verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted cer-
```
tificate authority (CA)
```
verify-full
only try an SSL connection, verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted CA and
that the requested server host name matches that in the certificate
See Section 32.19 for a detailed description of how these options work.
sslmode is ignored for Unix domain socket communication. If PostgreSQL is compiled without
SSL support, using options require, verify-ca, or verify-full will cause an error,
while options allow and prefer will be accepted but libpq will not actually attempt an SSL
connection.
Note that if GSSAPI encryption is possible, that will be used in preference to SSL encryption,
regardless of the value of sslmode. To force use of SSL encryption in an environment that has
```
working GSSAPI infrastructure (such as a Kerberos server), also set gssencmode to disable.
```
requiressl
This option is deprecated in favor of the sslmode setting.
```
If set to 1, an SSL connection to the server is required (this is equivalent to sslmode require).
```
```
libpq will then refuse to connect if the server does not accept an SSL connection. If set to 0 (de-
```
```
fault), libpq will negotiate the connection type with the server (equivalent to sslmode prefer).
```
This option is only available if PostgreSQL is compiled with SSL support.
sslnegotiation
This option controls how SSL encryption is negotiated with the server, if SSL is used. In the
default postgres mode, the client first asks the server if SSL is supported. In direct mode,
the client starts the standard SSL handshake directly after establishing the TCP/IP connection.
Traditional PostgreSQL protocol negotiation is the most flexible with different server configura-
tions. If the server is known to support direct SSL connections then the latter requires one fewer
round trip reducing connection latency and also allows the use of protocol agnostic SSL network
tools. The direct SSL option was introduced in PostgreSQL version 17.
postgres
perform PostgreSQL protocol negotiation. This is the default if the option is not provided.
direct
start SSL handshake directly after establishing the TCP/IP connection. This is only allowed
with sslmode=require or higher, because the weaker settings could lead to unintended
fallback to plaintext authentication when the server does not support direct SSL handshake.
975
libpq — C Library
sslcompression
If set to 1, data sent over SSL connections will be compressed. If set to 0, compression will be
disabled. The default is 0. This parameter is ignored if a connection without SSL is made.
SSL compression is nowadays considered insecure and its use is no longer recommended.
OpenSSL 1.1.0 disabled compression by default, and many operating system distributions dis-
abled it in prior versions as well, so setting this parameter to on will not have any effect if the server
does not accept compression. PostgreSQL 14 disabled compression completely in the backend.
If security is not a primary concern, compression can improve throughput if the network is the bot-
tleneck. Disabling compression can improve response time and throughput if CPU performance
is the limiting factor.
sslcert
This parameter specifies the file name of the client SSL certificate, replacing the default
~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt. This parameter is ignored if an SSL connection is not
made.
sslkey
This parameter specifies the location for the secret key used for the client certificate. It can
either specify a file name that will be used instead of the default ~/.postgresql/post-
```
gresql.key, or it can specify a key obtained from an external “engine” (engines are OpenSSL
```
```
loadable modules). An external engine specification should consist of a colon-separated engine
```
name and an engine-specific key identifier. This parameter is ignored if an SSL connection is
not made.
sslkeylogfile
This parameter specifies the location where libpq will log keys used in this SSL context. This
is useful for debugging PostgreSQL protocol interactions or client connections using network
inspection tools like Wireshark. This parameter is ignored if an SSL connection is not made, or if
```
LibreSSL is used (LibreSSL does not support key logging). Keys are logged using the NSS format.
```
Warning
Key logging will expose potentially sensitive information in the keylog file. Keylog files
should be handled with the same care as sslkey files.
sslpassword
This parameter specifies the password for the secret key specified in sslkey, allowing client
certificate private keys to be stored in encrypted form on disk even when interactive passphrase
input is not practical.
Specifying this parameter with any non-empty value suppresses the Enter PEM pass
```
phrase: prompt that OpenSSL will emit by default when an encrypted client certificate key
```
is provided to libpq.
If the key is not encrypted this parameter is ignored. The parameter has no effect on keys spec-
ified by OpenSSL engines unless the engine uses the OpenSSL password callback mechanism
for prompts.
There is no environment variable equivalent to this option, and no facility for looking it up in
.pgpass. It can be used in a service file connection definition. Users with more sophisticated
976
libpq — C Library
uses should consider using OpenSSL engines and tools like PKCS#11 or USB crypto offload
devices.
sslcertmode
This option determines whether a client certificate may be sent to the server, and whether the
server is required to request one. There are three modes:
disable
```
A client certificate is never sent, even if one is available (default location or provided via
```
```
sslcert).
```
```
allow (default)
```
A certificate may be sent, if the server requests one and the client has one to send.
require
The server must request a certificate. The connection will fail if the client does not send a
certificate and the server successfully authenticates the client anyway.
Note
```
sslcertmode=require doesn't add any additional security, since there is no guar-
```
```
antee that the server is validating the certificate correctly; PostgreSQL servers generally
```
request TLS certificates from clients whether they validate them or not. The option may
be useful when troubleshooting more complicated TLS setups.
sslrootcert
```
This parameter specifies the name of a file containing SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate(s).
```
If the file exists, the server's certificate will be verified to be signed by one of these authorities.
The default is ~/.postgresql/root.crt.
The special value system may be specified instead, in which case the trusted CA roots from the
SSL implementation will be loaded. The exact locations of these root certificates differ by SSL
implementation and platform. For OpenSSL in particular, the locations may be further modified
by the SSL_CERT_DIR and SSL_CERT_FILE environment variables.
Note
When using sslrootcert=system, the default sslmode is changed to veri-
fy-full, and any weaker setting will result in an error. In most cases it is trivial for
anyone to obtain a certificate trusted by the system for a hostname they control, rendering
verify-ca and all weaker modes useless.
The magic system value will take precedence over a local certificate file with the same
name. If for some reason you find yourself in this situation, use an alternative path like
```
sslrootcert=./system instead.
```
sslcrl
```
This parameter specifies the file name of the SSL server certificate revocation list (CRL). Cer-
```
tificates listed in this file, if it exists, will be rejected while attempting to authenticate the
977
libpq — C Library
server's certificate. If neither sslcrl nor sslcrldir is set, this setting is taken as ~/.post-
gresql/root.crl.
sslcrldir
```
This parameter specifies the directory name of the SSL server certificate revocation list (CRL).
```
Certificates listed in the files in this directory, if it exists, will be rejected while attempting to
authenticate the server's certificate.
The directory needs to be prepared with the OpenSSL command openssl rehash or c_re-
hash. See its documentation for details.
Both sslcrl and sslcrldir can be specified together.
sslsni
```
If set to 1 (default), libpq sets the TLS extension “Server Name Indication” (SNI) on SSL-enabled
```
connections. By setting this parameter to 0, this is turned off.
The Server Name Indication can be used by SSL-aware proxies to route connections without
```
having to decrypt the SSL stream. (Note that unless the proxy is aware of the PostgreSQL protocol
```
```
handshake this would require setting sslnegotiation to direct.) However, SNI makes
```
the destination host name appear in cleartext in the network traffic, so it might be undesirable
in some cases.
requirepeer
This parameter specifies the operating-system user name of the server, for example re-
```
quirepeer=postgres. When making a Unix-domain socket connection, if this parameter is
```
set, the client checks at the beginning of the connection that the server process is running under
```
the specified user name; if it is not, the connection is aborted with an error. This parameter can
```
be used to provide server authentication similar to that available with SSL certificates on TCP/
```
IP connections. (Note that if the Unix-domain socket is in /tmp or another publicly writable
```
location, any user could start a server listening there. Use this parameter to ensure that you are
```
connected to a server run by a trusted user.) This option is only supported on platforms for which
```
```
the peer authentication method is implemented; see Section 20.9.
```
ssl_min_protocol_version
This parameter specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol version to allow for the connection.
Valid values are TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. The supported protocols depend
on the version of OpenSSL used, older versions not supporting the most modern protocol versions.
If not specified, the default is TLSv1.2, which satisfies industry best practices as of this writing.
ssl_max_protocol_version
This parameter specifies the maximum SSL/TLS protocol version to allow for the connection.
Valid values are TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. The supported protocols depend
on the version of OpenSSL used, older versions not supporting the most modern protocol versions.
If not set, this parameter is ignored and the connection will use the maximum bound defined by
the backend, if set. Setting the maximum protocol version is mainly useful for testing or if some
component has issues working with a newer protocol.
min_protocol_version
Specifies the minimum protocol version to allow for the connection. The default is to allow any
version of the PostgreSQL protocol supported by libpq, which currently means 3.0. If the server
does not support at least this protocol version the connection will be closed.
The current supported values are 3.0, 3.2, and latest. The latest value is equivalent to
the latest protocol version supported by the libpq version being used, which is currently 3.2.
978
libpq — C Library
max_protocol_version
Specifies the protocol version to request from the server. The default is to use version 3.0 of
the PostgreSQL protocol, unless the connection string specifies a feature that relies on a higher
protocol version, in which case the latest version supported by libpq is used. If the server does not
support the protocol version requested by the client, the connection is automatically downgrad-
ed to a lower minor protocol version that the server supports. After the connection attempt has
completed you can use PQfullProtocolVersion to find out which exact protocol version
was negotiated.
The current supported values are 3.0, 3.2, and latest. The latest value is equivalent to
the latest protocol version supported by the libpq version being used, which is currently 3.2.
krbsrvname
Kerberos service name to use when authenticating with GSSAPI. This must match the service
```
name specified in the server configuration for Kerberos authentication to succeed. (See also Sec-
```
```
tion 20.6.) The default value is normally postgres, but that can be changed when building
```
PostgreSQL via the --with-krb-srvnam option of configure. In most environments, this pa-
rameter never needs to be changed. Some Kerberos implementations might require a different
service name, such as Microsoft Active Directory which requires the service name to be in upper
```
case (POSTGRES).
```
gsslib
GSS library to use for GSSAPI authentication. Currently this is disregarded except on Windows
builds that include both GSSAPI and SSPI support. In that case, set this to gssapi to cause libpq
to use the GSSAPI library for authentication instead of the default SSPI.
gssdelegation
```
Forward (delegate) GSS credentials to the server. The default is 0 which means credentials will
```
not be forwarded to the server. Set this to 1 to have credentials forwarded when possible.
scram_client_key
The base64-encoded SCRAM client key. This can be used by foreign-data wrappers or similar
middleware to enable pass-through SCRAM authentication. See Section F.38.1.10 for one such
implementation. It is not meant to be specified directly by users or client applications.
scram_server_key
The base64-encoded SCRAM server key. This can be used by foreign-data wrappers or similar
middleware to enable pass-through SCRAM authentication. See Section F.38.1.10 for one such
implementation. It is not meant to be specified directly by users or client applications.
service
Service name to use for additional parameters. It specifies a service name in pg_ser-
vice.conf that holds additional connection parameters. This allows applications to specify
only a service name so connection parameters can be centrally maintained. See Section 32.17.
target_session_attrs
This option determines whether the session must have certain properties to be acceptable. It's
typically used in combination with multiple host names to select the first acceptable alternative
among several hosts. There are six modes:
```
any (default)
```
any successful connection is acceptable
979
libpq — C Library
read-write
```
session must accept read-write transactions by default (that is, the server must not be in hot
```
```
standby mode and the default_transaction_read_only parameter must be off)
```
read-only
```
session must not accept read-write transactions by default (the converse)
```
primary
server must not be in hot standby mode
standby
server must be in hot standby mode
prefer-standby
first try to find a standby server, but if none of the listed hosts is a standby server, try again
in any mode
load_balance_hosts
Controls the order in which the client tries to connect to the available hosts and addresses. Once
a connection attempt is successful no other hosts and addresses will be tried. This parameter is
typically used in combination with multiple host names or a DNS record that returns multiple IPs.
This parameter can be used in combination with target_session_attrs to, for example, load balance
over standby servers only. Once successfully connected, subsequent queries on the returned con-
nection will all be sent to the same server. There are currently two modes:
```
disable (default)
```
No load balancing across hosts is performed. Hosts are tried in the order in which they are
provided and addresses are tried in the order they are received from DNS or a hosts file.
random
Hosts and addresses are tried in random order. This value is mostly useful when opening
multiple connections at the same time, possibly from different machines. This way connec-
tions can be load balanced across multiple PostgreSQL servers.
While random load balancing, due to its random nature, will almost never result in a com-
pletely uniform distribution, it statistically gets quite close. One important aspect here is that
this algorithm uses two levels of random choices: First the hosts will be resolved in random
order. Then secondly, before resolving the next host, all resolved addresses for the current
host will be tried in random order. This behaviour can skew the amount of connections each
node gets greatly in certain cases, for instance when some hosts resolve to more addresses
than others. But such a skew can also be used on purpose, e.g. to increase the number of
connections a larger server gets by providing its hostname multiple times in the host string.
When using this value it's recommended to also configure a reasonable value for connec-
t_timeout. Because then, if one of the nodes that are used for load balancing is not respond-
ing, a new node will be tried.
oauth_issuer
The HTTPS URL of a trusted issuer to contact if the server requests an OAuth token for the
```
connection. This parameter is required for all OAuth connections; it should exactly match the
```
issuer setting in the server's HBA configuration.
As part of the standard authentication handshake, libpq will ask the server for a discovery doc-
```
ument: a URL providing a set of OAuth configuration parameters. The server must provide a
```
980
libpq — C Library
URL that is directly constructed from the components of the oauth_issuer, and this value
must exactly match the issuer identifier that is declared in the discovery document itself, or the
connection will fail. This is required to prevent a class of "mix-up attacks"3 on OAuth clients.
You may also explicitly set oauth_issuer to the /.well-known/ URI used for OAuth
discovery. In this case, if the server asks for a different URL, the connection will fail, but a custom
OAuth flow may be able to speed up the standard handshake by using previously cached tokens.
```
(In this case, it is recommended that oauth_scope be set as well, since the client will not have a
```
chance to ask the server for a correct scope setting, and the default scopes for a token may not be
```
sufficient to connect.) libpq currently supports the following well-known endpoints:
```
• /.well-known/openid-configuration
• /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
Warning
Issuers are highly privileged during the OAuth connection handshake. As a rule of thumb,
if you would not trust the operator of a URL to handle access to your servers, or to im-
personate you directly, that URL should not be trusted as an oauth_issuer.
oauth_client_id
An OAuth 2.0 client identifier, as issued by the authorization server. If the PostgreSQL server
```
requests an OAuth token for the connection (and if no custom OAuth hook is installed to provide
```
```
one), then this parameter must be set; otherwise, the connection will fail.
```
oauth_client_secret
The client password, if any, to use when contacting the OAuth authorization server. Whether this
```
parameter is required or not is determined by the OAuth provider; "public" clients generally do
```
not use a secret, whereas "confidential" clients generally do.
oauth_scope
```
The scope of the access request sent to the authorization server, specified as a (possibly empty)
```
space-separated list of OAuth scope identifiers. This parameter is optional and intended for ad-
vanced usage.
Usually the client will obtain appropriate scope settings from the PostgreSQL server. If this pa-
rameter is used, the server's requested scope list will be ignored. This can prevent a less-trusted
server from requesting inappropriate access scopes from the end user. However, if the client's
scope setting does not contain the server's required scopes, the server is likely to reject the issued
token, and the connection will fail.
The meaning of an empty scope list is provider-dependent. An OAuth authorization server may
choose to issue a token with "default scope", whatever that happens to be, or it may reject the
token request entirely.
32.2. Connection Status Functions
These functions can be used to interrogate the status of an existing database connection object.
Tip
libpq application programmers should be careful to maintain the PGconn abstraction. Use
the accessor functions described below to get at the contents of PGconn. Reference to internal
3 https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/oauth/JIVxFBGsJBVtm7ljwJhPUm3Fr-w/
981
libpq — C Library
PGconn fields using libpq-int.h is not recommended because they are subject to change
in the future.
The following functions return parameter values established at connection. These values are fixed for
the life of the connection. If a multi-host connection string is used, the values of PQhost, PQport,
and PQpass can change if a new connection is established using the same PGconn object. Other
values are fixed for the lifetime of the PGconn object.
PQdb
Returns the database name of the connection.
```
char *PQdb(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQuser
Returns the user name of the connection.
```
char *PQuser(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQpass
Returns the password of the connection.
```
char *PQpass(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQpass will return either the password specified in the connection parameters, or if there was
none and the password was obtained from the password file, it will return that. In the latter case, if
multiple hosts were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result
of PQpass until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using
the function PQstatus.
PQhost
Returns the server host name of the active connection. This can be a host name, an IP address, or
```
a directory path if the connection is via Unix socket. (The path case can be distinguished because
```
```
it will always be an absolute path, beginning with /.)
```
```
char *PQhost(const PGconn *conn);
```
If the connection parameters specified both host and hostaddr, then PQhost will return the
host information. If only hostaddr was specified, then that is returned. If multiple hosts were
specified in the connection parameters, PQhost returns the host actually connected to.
PQhost returns NULL if the conn argument is NULL. Otherwise, if there is an error producing
```
the host information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was an
```
```
error), it returns an empty string.
```
If multiple hosts were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result
of PQhost until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using
the function PQstatus.
PQhostaddr
Returns the server IP address of the active connection. This can be the address that a host name
resolved to, or an IP address provided through the hostaddr parameter.
982
libpq — C Library
```
char *PQhostaddr(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQhostaddr returns NULL if the conn argument is NULL. Otherwise, if there is an error pro-
```
ducing the host information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was
```
```
an error), it returns an empty string.
```
PQport
Returns the port of the active connection.
```
char *PQport(const PGconn *conn);
```
If multiple ports were specified in the connection parameters, PQport returns the port actually
connected to.
PQport returns NULL if the conn argument is NULL. Otherwise, if there is an error producing
```
the port information (perhaps if the connection has not been fully established or there was an
```
```
error), it returns an empty string.
```
If multiple ports were specified in the connection parameters, it is not possible to rely on the result
of PQport until the connection is established. The status of the connection can be checked using
the function PQstatus.
PQtty
This function no longer does anything, but it remains for backwards compatibility. The function
always return an empty string, or NULL if the conn argument is NULL.
```
char *PQtty(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQoptions
Returns the command-line options passed in the connection request.
```
char *PQoptions(const PGconn *conn);
```
The following functions return status data that can change as operations are executed on the PGconn
object.
PQstatus
Returns the status of the connection.
```
ConnStatusType PQstatus(const PGconn *conn);
```
The status can be one of a number of values. However, only two of these are seen outside of an
asynchronous connection procedure: CONNECTION_OK and CONNECTION_BAD. A good con-
nection to the database has the status CONNECTION_OK. A failed connection attempt is signaled
by status CONNECTION_BAD. Ordinarily, an OK status will remain so until PQfinish, but a
communications failure might result in the status changing to CONNECTION_BAD prematurely.
In that case the application could try to recover by calling PQreset.
See the entry for PQconnectStartParams, PQconnectStart and PQconnectPoll
with regards to other status codes that might be returned.
983
libpq — C Library
PQtransactionStatus
Returns the current in-transaction status of the server.
```
PGTransactionStatusType PQtransactionStatus(const PGconn *conn);
```
```
The status can be PQTRANS_IDLE (currently idle), PQTRANS_ACTIVE (a command is in
```
```
progress), PQTRANS_INTRANS (idle, in a valid transaction block), or PQTRANS_INERROR
```
```
(idle, in a failed transaction block). PQTRANS_UNKNOWN is reported if the connection is bad.
```
PQTRANS_ACTIVE is reported only when a query has been sent to the server and not yet com-
pleted.
PQparameterStatus
Looks up a current parameter setting of the server.
```
const char *PQparameterStatus(const PGconn *conn, const char
```
```
*paramName);
```
Certain parameter values are reported by the server automatically at connection startup or when-
ever their values change. PQparameterStatus can be used to interrogate these settings. It
returns the current value of a parameter if known, or NULL if the parameter is not known.
Parameters reported as of the current release include:
application_name scram_iterations
client_encoding search_path
DateStyle server_encoding
default_transaction_read_only server_version
in_hot_standby session_authorization
integer_datetimes standard_conforming_strings
IntervalStyle TimeZone
is_superuser
```
(default_transaction_read_only and in_hot_standby were not reported by re-
```
```
leases before 14; scram_iterations was not reported by releases before 16; search_path
```
```
was not reported by releases before 18.) Note that server_version, server_encoding
```
and integer_datetimes cannot change after startup.
If no value for standard_conforming_strings is reported, applications can assume it
is off, that is, backslashes are treated as escapes in string literals. Also, the presence of this
```
parameter can be taken as an indication that the escape string syntax (E'...') is accepted.
```
Although the returned pointer is declared const, it in fact points to mutable storage associated
with the PGconn structure. It is unwise to assume the pointer will remain valid across queries.
PQfullProtocolVersion
Interrogates the frontend/backend protocol being used.
```
int PQfullProtocolVersion(const PGconn *conn);
```
Applications might wish to use this function to determine whether certain features are supported.
The result is formed by multiplying the server's major version number by 10000 and adding the
minor version number. For example, version 3.2 would be returned as 30002, and version 4.0
would be returned as 40000. Zero is returned if the connection is bad. The 3.0 protocol is supported
by PostgreSQL server versions 7.4 and above.
984
libpq — C Library
The protocol version will not change after connection startup is complete, but it could theoretically
change during a connection reset.
PQprotocolVersion
Interrogates the frontend/backend protocol major version.
```
int PQprotocolVersion(const PGconn *conn);
```
Unlike PQfullProtocolVersion, this returns only the major protocol version in use, but
it is supported by a wider range of libpq releases back to version 7.4. Currently, the possible
```
values are 3 (3.0 protocol), or zero (connection bad). Prior to release version 14.0, libpq could
```
```
additionally return 2 (2.0 protocol).
```
PQserverVersion
Returns an integer representing the server version.
```
int PQserverVersion(const PGconn *conn);
```
Applications might use this function to determine the version of the database server they are
connected to. The result is formed by multiplying the server's major version number by 10000
and adding the minor version number. For example, version 10.1 will be returned as 100001, and
version 11.0 will be returned as 110000. Zero is returned if the connection is bad.
Prior to major version 10, PostgreSQL used three-part version numbers in which the first two
parts together represented the major version. For those versions, PQserverVersion uses two
```
digits for each part; for example version 9.1.5 will be returned as 90105, and version 9.2.0 will
```
be returned as 90200.
Therefore, for purposes of determining feature compatibility, applications should divide the result
of PQserverVersion by 100 not 10000 to determine a logical major version number. In all
```
release series, only the last two digits differ between minor releases (bug-fix releases).
```
PQerrorMessage
Returns the error message most recently generated by an operation on the connection.
```
char *PQerrorMessage(const PGconn *conn);
```
Nearly all libpq functions will set a message for PQerrorMessage if they fail. Note that by
libpq convention, a nonempty PQerrorMessage result can consist of multiple lines, and will
include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the
associated PGconn handle is passed to PQfinish. The result string should not be expected to
remain the same across operations on the PGconn structure.
PQsocket
Obtains the file descriptor number of the connection socket to the server. A valid descriptor will
```
be greater than or equal to 0; a result of -1 indicates that no server connection is currently open.
```
```
(This will not change during normal operation, but could change during connection setup or reset.)
```
```
int PQsocket(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQbackendPID
```
Returns the process ID (PID) of the backend process handling this connection.
```
985
libpq — C Library
```
int PQbackendPID(const PGconn *conn);
```
The backend PID is useful for debugging purposes and for comparison to NOTIFY messages
```
(which include the PID of the notifying backend process). Note that the PID belongs to a process
```
executing on the database server host, not the local host!
PQconnectionNeedsPassword
```
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method required a password, but none was avail-
```
```
able. Returns false (0) if not.
```
```
int PQconnectionNeedsPassword(const PGconn *conn);
```
This function can be applied after a failed connection attempt to decide whether to prompt the
user for a password.
PQconnectionUsedPassword
```
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method used a password. Returns false (0) if not.
```
```
int PQconnectionUsedPassword(const PGconn *conn);
```
This function can be applied after either a failed or successful connection attempt to detect whether
the server demanded a password.
PQconnectionUsedGSSAPI
```
Returns true (1) if the connection authentication method used GSSAPI. Returns false (0) if not.
```
```
int PQconnectionUsedGSSAPI(const PGconn *conn);
```
This function can be applied to detect whether the connection was authenticated with GSSAPI.
The following functions return information related to SSL. This information usually doesn't change
after a connection is established.
PQsslInUse
```
Returns true (1) if the connection uses SSL, false (0) if not.
```
```
int PQsslInUse(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQsslAttribute
Returns SSL-related information about the connection.
```
const char *PQsslAttribute(const PGconn *conn, const char
```
```
*attribute_name);
```
The list of available attributes varies depending on the SSL library being used and the type of
connection. Returns NULL if the connection does not use SSL or the specified attribute name is
not defined for the library in use.
The following attributes are commonly available:
986
libpq — C Library
library
```
Name of the SSL implementation in use. (Currently, only "OpenSSL" is implemented)
```
protocol
SSL/TLS version in use. Common values are "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1" and "TLSv1.2",
but an implementation may return other strings if some other protocol is used.
key_bits
Number of key bits used by the encryption algorithm.
cipher
A short name of the ciphersuite used, e.g., "DHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA". The names are
specific to each SSL implementation.
compression
Returns "on" if SSL compression is in use, else it returns "off".
alpn
```
Application protocol selected by the TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
```
extension. The only protocol supported by libpq is postgresql, so this is mainly useful
for checking whether the server supported ALPN or not. Empty string if ALPN was not used.
As a special case, the library attribute may be queried without a connection by passing NULL
as the conn argument. The result will be the default SSL library name, or NULL if libpq was
```
compiled without any SSL support. (Prior to PostgreSQL version 15, passing NULL as the conn
```
argument always resulted in NULL. Client programs needing to differentiate between the newer
and older implementations of this case may check the LIBPQ_HAS_SSL_LIBRARY_DETEC-
```
TION feature macro.)
```
PQsslAttributeNames
```
Returns an array of SSL attribute names that can be used in PQsslAttribute(). The array
```
is terminated by a NULL pointer.
```
const char * const * PQsslAttributeNames(const PGconn *conn);
```
If conn is NULL, the attributes available for the default SSL library are returned, or an empty
list if libpq was compiled without any SSL support. If conn is not NULL, the attributes available
for the SSL library in use for the connection are returned, or an empty list if the connection is
not encrypted.
PQsslStruct
Returns a pointer to an SSL-implementation-specific object describing the connection. Returns
NULL if the connection is not encrypted or the requested type of object is not available from the
connection's SSL implementation.
```
void *PQsslStruct(const PGconn *conn, const char *struct_name);
```
```
The struct(s) available depend on the SSL implementation in use. For OpenSSL, there is one
```
struct, available under the name OpenSSL, and it returns a pointer to OpenSSL's SSL struct. To
use this function, code along the following lines could be used:
987
libpq — C Library
#include <libpq-fe.h>
#include <openssl/ssl.h>
...
```
SSL *ssl;
```
```
dbconn = PQconnectdb(...);
```
...
```
ssl = PQsslStruct(dbconn, "OpenSSL");
```
```
if (ssl)
```
```
{
```
/* use OpenSSL functions to access ssl */
```
}
```
This structure can be used to verify encryption levels, check server certificates, and more. Refer
to the OpenSSL documentation for information about this structure.
PQgetssl
Returns the SSL structure used in the connection, or NULL if SSL is not in use.
```
void *PQgetssl(const PGconn *conn);
```
```
This function is equivalent to PQsslStruct(conn, "OpenSSL"). It should not be used
```
in new applications, because the returned struct is specific to OpenSSL and will not be available
if another SSL implementation is used. To check if a connection uses SSL, call PQsslInUse
instead, and for more details about the connection, use PQsslAttribute.
32.3. Command Execution Functions
Once a connection to a database server has been successfully established, the functions described here
are used to perform SQL queries and commands.
32.3.1. Main Functions
PQexec
Submits a command to the server and waits for the result.
```
PGresult *PQexec(PGconn *conn, const char *command);
```
Returns a PGresult pointer or possibly a null pointer. A non-null pointer will generally be re-
turned except in out-of-memory conditions or serious errors such as inability to send the command
to the server. The PQresultStatus function should be called to check the return value for any
```
errors (including the value of a null pointer, in which case it will return PGRES_FATAL_ERROR).
```
Use PQerrorMessage to get more information about such errors.
```
The command string can include multiple SQL commands (separated by semicolons). Multiple queries
```
sent in a single PQexec call are processed in a single transaction, unless there are explicit BEGIN/
```
COMMIT commands included in the query string to divide it into multiple transactions. (See Sec-
```
```
tion 54.2.2.1 for more details about how the server handles multi-query strings.) Note however that the
```
returned PGresult structure describes only the result of the last command executed from the string.
988
libpq — C Library
Should one of the commands fail, processing of the string stops with it and the returned PGresult
describes the error condition.
PQexecParams
Submits a command to the server and waits for the result, with the ability to pass parameters
separately from the SQL command text.
```
PGresult *PQexecParams(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *command,
int nParams,
const Oid *paramTypes,
const char * const *paramValues,
const int *paramLengths,
const int *paramFormats,
```
int resultFormat);
```
PQexecParams is like PQexec, but offers additional functionality: parameter values can be
specified separately from the command string proper, and query results can be requested in either
text or binary format.
The function arguments are:
conn
The connection object to send the command through.
command
The SQL command string to be executed. If parameters are used, they are referred to in the
command string as $1, $2, etc.
nParams
```
The number of parameters supplied; it is the length of the arrays paramTypes[],
```
```
paramValues[], paramLengths[], and paramFormats[]. (The array pointers can
```
```
be NULL when nParams is zero.)
```
paramTypes[]
Specifies, by OID, the data types to be assigned to the parameter symbols. If paramTypes
is NULL, or any particular element in the array is zero, the server infers a data type for the
parameter symbol in the same way it would do for an untyped literal string.
paramValues[]
Specifies the actual values of the parameters. A null pointer in this array means the corre-
```
sponding parameter is null; otherwise the pointer points to a zero-terminated text string (for
```
```
text format) or binary data in the format expected by the server (for binary format).
```
paramLengths[]
Specifies the actual data lengths of binary-format parameters. It is ignored for null parame-
ters and text-format parameters. The array pointer can be null when there are no binary pa-
rameters.
paramFormats[]
```
Specifies whether parameters are text (put a zero in the array entry for the corresponding
```
```
parameter) or binary (put a one in the array entry for the corresponding parameter). If the
```
array pointer is null then all parameters are presumed to be text strings.
989
libpq — C Library
Values passed in binary format require knowledge of the internal representation expect-
ed by the backend. For example, integers must be passed in network byte order. Pass-
ing numeric values requires knowledge of the server storage format, as implemented
```
in src/backend/utils/adt/numeric.c::numeric_send() and src/back-
```
```
end/utils/adt/numeric.c::numeric_recv().
```
resultFormat
```
Specify zero to obtain results in text format, or one to obtain results in binary format. (There
```
is not currently a provision to obtain different result columns in different formats, although
```
that is possible in the underlying protocol.)
```
The primary advantage of PQexecParams over PQexec is that parameter values can be separated
from the command string, thus avoiding the need for tedious and error-prone quoting and escaping.
```
Unlike PQexec, PQexecParams allows at most one SQL command in the given string. (There can
```
```
be semicolons in it, but not more than one nonempty command.) This is a limitation of the underlying
```
protocol, but has some usefulness as an extra defense against SQL-injection attacks.
Tip
Specifying parameter types via OIDs is tedious, particularly if you prefer not to hard-wire
particular OID values into your program. However, you can avoid doing so even in cases
where the server by itself cannot determine the type of the parameter, or chooses a different
type than you want. In the SQL command text, attach an explicit cast to the parameter symbol
to show what data type you will send. For example:
```
SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE x = $1::bigint;
```
This forces parameter $1 to be treated as bigint, whereas by default it would be assigned
the same type as x. Forcing the parameter type decision, either this way or by specifying a
numeric type OID, is strongly recommended when sending parameter values in binary format,
because binary format has less redundancy than text format and so there is less chance that the
server will detect a type mismatch mistake for you.
PQprepare
Submits a request to create a prepared statement with the given parameters, and waits for com-
pletion.
```
PGresult *PQprepare(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *stmtName,
const char *query,
int nParams,
```
const Oid *paramTypes);
```
PQprepare creates a prepared statement for later execution with PQexecPrepared. This
```
feature allows commands to be executed repeatedly without being parsed and planned each time;
```
see PREPARE for details.
The function creates a prepared statement named stmtName from the query string, which must
contain a single SQL command. stmtName can be "" to create an unnamed statement, in which
```
case any pre-existing unnamed statement is automatically replaced; otherwise it is an error if the
```
statement name is already defined in the current session. If any parameters are used, they are
referred to in the query as $1, $2, etc. nParams is the number of parameters for which types are
990
libpq — C Library
```
pre-specified in the array paramTypes[]. (The array pointer can be NULL when nParams is
```
```
zero.) paramTypes[] specifies, by OID, the data types to be assigned to the parameter symbols.
```
If paramTypes is NULL, or any particular element in the array is zero, the server assigns a data
type to the parameter symbol in the same way it would do for an untyped literal string. Also,
```
the query can use parameter symbols with numbers higher than nParams; data types will be
```
```
inferred for these symbols as well. (See PQdescribePrepared for a means to find out what
```
```
data types were inferred.)
```
As with PQexec, the result is normally a PGresult object whose contents indicate server-side
success or failure. A null result indicates out-of-memory or inability to send the command at all.
Use PQerrorMessage to get more information about such errors.
Prepared statements for use with PQexecPrepared can also be created by executing SQL PRE-
PARE statements.
PQexecPrepared
Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, and waits for the result.
```
PGresult *PQexecPrepared(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *stmtName,
int nParams,
const char * const *paramValues,
const int *paramLengths,
const int *paramFormats,
```
int resultFormat);
```
PQexecPrepared is like PQexecParams, but the command to be executed is specified by
naming a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query string. This feature allows
commands that will be used repeatedly to be parsed and planned just once, rather than each time
they are executed. The statement must have been prepared previously in the current session.
The parameters are identical to PQexecParams, except that the name of a prepared statement
```
is given instead of a query string, and the paramTypes[] parameter is not present (it is not
```
```
needed since the prepared statement's parameter types were determined when it was created).
```
PQdescribePrepared
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified prepared statement, and waits for
completion.
```
PGresult *PQdescribePrepared(PGconn *conn, const char
```
```
*stmtName);
```
PQdescribePrepared allows an application to obtain information about a previously pre-
pared statement.
stmtName can be "" or NULL to reference the unnamed statement, otherwise it must be the
name of an existing prepared statement. On success, a PGresult with status PGRES_COM-
MAND_OK is returned. The functions PQnparams and PQparamtype can be applied to this
PGresult to obtain information about the parameters of the prepared statement, and the func-
```
tions PQnfields, PQfname, PQftype, etc. provide information about the result columns (if
```
```
any) of the statement.
```
PQdescribePortal
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified portal, and waits for completion.
991
libpq — C Library
```
PGresult *PQdescribePortal(PGconn *conn, const char
```
```
*portalName);
```
PQdescribePortal allows an application to obtain information about a previously created
```
portal. (libpq does not provide any direct access to portals, but you can use this function to inspect
```
```
the properties of a cursor created with a DECLARE CURSOR SQL command.)
```
portalName can be "" or NULL to reference the unnamed portal, otherwise it must be the name
of an existing portal. On success, a PGresult with status PGRES_COMMAND_OK is returned.
The functions PQnfields, PQfname, PQftype, etc. can be applied to the PGresult to
```
obtain information about the result columns (if any) of the portal.
```
PQclosePrepared
Submits a request to close the specified prepared statement, and waits for completion.
```
PGresult *PQclosePrepared(PGconn *conn, const char *stmtName);
```
PQclosePrepared allows an application to close a previously prepared statement. Closing a
statement releases all of its associated resources on the server and allows its name to be reused.
stmtName can be "" or NULL to reference the unnamed statement. It is fine if no statement
exists with this name, in that case the operation is a no-op. On success, a PGresult with status
PGRES_COMMAND_OK is returned.
PQclosePortal
Submits a request to close the specified portal, and waits for completion.
```
PGresult *PQclosePortal(PGconn *conn, const char *portalName);
```
PQclosePortal allows an application to trigger a close of a previously created portal. Closing
a portal releases all of its associated resources on the server and allows its name to be reused.
```
(libpq does not provide any direct access to portals, but you can use this function to close a cursor
```
```
created with a DECLARE CURSOR SQL command.)
```
portalName can be "" or NULL to reference the unnamed portal. It is fine if no portal ex-
ists with this name, in that case the operation is a no-op. On success, a PGresult with status
PGRES_COMMAND_OK is returned.
The PGresult structure encapsulates the result returned by the server. libpq application program-
mers should be careful to maintain the PGresult abstraction. Use the accessor functions below to
get at the contents of PGresult. Avoid directly referencing the fields of the PGresult structure
because they are subject to change in the future.
PQresultStatus
Returns the result status of the command.
```
ExecStatusType PQresultStatus(const PGresult *res);
```
PQresultStatus can return one of the following values:
PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY
The string sent to the server was empty.
992
libpq — C Library
PGRES_COMMAND_OK
Successful completion of a command returning no data.
PGRES_TUPLES_OK
```
Successful completion of a command returning data (such as a SELECT or SHOW).
```
PGRES_COPY_OUT
```
Copy Out (from server) data transfer started.
```
PGRES_COPY_IN
```
Copy In (to server) data transfer started.
```
PGRES_BAD_RESPONSE
The server's response was not understood.
PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR
```
A nonfatal error (a notice or warning) occurred.
```
PGRES_FATAL_ERROR
A fatal error occurred.
PGRES_COPY_BOTH
```
Copy In/Out (to and from server) data transfer started. This feature is currently used only for
```
streaming replication, so this status should not occur in ordinary applications.
PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE
The PGresult contains a single result tuple from the current command. This status occurs
```
only when single-row mode has been selected for the query (see Section 32.6).
```
PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK
The PGresult contains several result tuples from the current command. This status occurs
```
only when chunked mode has been selected for the query (see Section 32.6). The number of
```
tuples will not exceed the limit passed to PQsetChunkedRowsMode.
PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC
The PGresult represents a synchronization point in pipeline mode, requested by either
PQpipelineSync or PQsendPipelineSync. This status occurs only when pipeline
mode has been selected.
PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED
The PGresult represents a pipeline that has received an error from the server. PQgetRe-
sult must be called repeatedly, and each time it will return this status code until the end
of the current pipeline, at which point it will return PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC and normal
processing can resume.
If the result status is PGRES_TUPLES_OK, PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE, or PGRES_TU-
PLES_CHUNK, then the functions described below can be used to retrieve the rows returned by the
query. Note that a SELECT command that happens to retrieve zero rows still shows PGRES_TU-
```
PLES_OK. PGRES_COMMAND_OK is for commands that can never return rows (INSERT or UP-
```
993
libpq — C Library
```
DATE without a RETURNING clause, etc.). A response of PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY might indi-
```
cate a bug in the client software.
A result of status PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR will never be returned directly by PQexec or
```
other query execution functions; results of this kind are instead passed to the notice processor
```
```
(see Section 32.13).
```
PQresStatus
Converts the enumerated type returned by PQresultStatus into a string constant describing
the status code. The caller should not free the result.
```
char *PQresStatus(ExecStatusType status);
```
PQresultErrorMessage
Returns the error message associated with the command, or an empty string if there was no error.
```
char *PQresultErrorMessage(const PGresult *res);
```
If there was an error, the returned string will include a trailing newline. The caller should not free
the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to PQclear.
```
Immediately following a PQexec or PQgetResult call, PQerrorMessage (on the con-
```
```
nection) will return the same string as PQresultErrorMessage (on the result). However, a
```
PGresult will retain its error message until destroyed, whereas the connection's error message
will change when subsequent operations are done. Use PQresultErrorMessage when you
```
want to know the status associated with a particular PGresult; use PQerrorMessage when
```
you want to know the status from the latest operation on the connection.
PQresultVerboseErrorMessage
Returns a reformatted version of the error message associated with a PGresult object.
```
char *PQresultVerboseErrorMessage(const PGresult *res,
```
PGVerbosity verbosity,
PGContextVisibility
```
show_context);
```
In some situations a client might wish to obtain a more detailed version of a previously-reported
error. PQresultVerboseErrorMessage addresses this need by computing the message that
would have been produced by PQresultErrorMessage if the specified verbosity settings
had been in effect for the connection when the given PGresult was generated. If the PGresult
is not an error result, “PGresult is not an error result” is reported instead. The returned string
includes a trailing newline.
Unlike most other functions for extracting data from a PGresult, the result of this function
```
is a freshly allocated string. The caller must free it using PQfreemem() when the string is no
```
longer needed.
A NULL return is possible if there is insufficient memory.
PQresultErrorField
Returns an individual field of an error report.
994
libpq — C Library
```
char *PQresultErrorField(const PGresult *res, int fieldcode);
```
```
fieldcode is an error field identifier; see the symbols listed below. NULL is returned if the
```
PGresult is not an error or warning result, or does not include the specified field. Field values
will normally not include a trailing newline. The caller should not free the result directly. It will
be freed when the associated PGresult handle is passed to PQclear.
The following field codes are available:
PG_DIAG_SEVERITY
```
The severity; the field contents are ERROR, FATAL, or PANIC (in an error message), or
```
```
WARNING, NOTICE, DEBUG, INFO, or LOG (in a notice message), or a localized translation
```
of one of these. Always present.
PG_DIAG_SEVERITY_NONLOCALIZED
```
The severity; the field contents are ERROR, FATAL, or PANIC (in an error message), or
```
```
WARNING, NOTICE, DEBUG, INFO, or LOG (in a notice message). This is identical to the
```
PG_DIAG_SEVERITY field except that the contents are never localized. This is present only
in reports generated by PostgreSQL versions 9.6 and later.
PG_DIAG_SQLSTATE
The SQLSTATE code for the error. The SQLSTATE code identifies the type of error that has
```
occurred; it can be used by front-end applications to perform specific operations (such as error
```
```
handling) in response to a particular database error. For a list of the possible SQLSTATE
```
codes, see Appendix A. This field is not localizable, and is always present.
PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_PRIMARY
```
The primary human-readable error message (typically one line). Always present.
```
PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_DETAIL
```
Detail: an optional secondary error message carrying more detail about the problem. Might
```
run to multiple lines.
PG_DIAG_MESSAGE_HINT
```
Hint: an optional suggestion what to do about the problem. This is intended to differ from
```
```
detail in that it offers advice (potentially inappropriate) rather than hard facts. Might run to
```
multiple lines.
PG_DIAG_STATEMENT_POSITION
A string containing a decimal integer indicating an error cursor position as an index into
the original statement string. The first character has index 1, and positions are measured in
characters not bytes.
PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_POSITION
This is defined the same as the PG_DIAG_STATEMENT_POSITION field, but it is used
when the cursor position refers to an internally generated command rather than the one sub-
mitted by the client. The PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_QUERY field will always appear when this
field appears.
PG_DIAG_INTERNAL_QUERY
The text of a failed internally-generated command. This could be, for example, an SQL query
issued by a PL/pgSQL function.
995
libpq — C Library
PG_DIAG_CONTEXT
An indication of the context in which the error occurred. Presently this includes a call stack
traceback of active procedural language functions and internally-generated queries. The trace
is one entry per line, most recent first.
PG_DIAG_SCHEMA_NAME
If the error was associated with a specific database object, the name of the schema containing
that object, if any.
PG_DIAG_TABLE_NAME
```
If the error was associated with a specific table, the name of the table. (Refer to the schema
```
```
name field for the name of the table's schema.)
```
PG_DIAG_COLUMN_NAME
```
If the error was associated with a specific table column, the name of the column. (Refer to
```
```
the schema and table name fields to identify the table.)
```
PG_DIAG_DATATYPE_NAME
```
If the error was associated with a specific data type, the name of the data type. (Refer to the
```
```
schema name field for the name of the data type's schema.)
```
PG_DIAG_CONSTRAINT_NAME
If the error was associated with a specific constraint, the name of the constraint. Refer to
```
fields listed above for the associated table or domain. (For this purpose, indexes are treated
```
```
as constraints, even if they weren't created with constraint syntax.)
```
PG_DIAG_SOURCE_FILE
The file name of the source-code location where the error was reported.
PG_DIAG_SOURCE_LINE
The line number of the source-code location where the error was reported.
PG_DIAG_SOURCE_FUNCTION
The name of the source-code function reporting the error.
Note
The fields for schema name, table name, column name, data type name, and constraint
```
name are supplied only for a limited number of error types; see Appendix A. Do not
```
assume that the presence of any of these fields guarantees the presence of another field.
Core error sources observe the interrelationships noted above, but user-defined functions
may use these fields in other ways. In the same vein, do not assume that these fields denote
contemporary objects in the current database.
```
The client is responsible for formatting displayed information to meet its needs; in particular it
```
should break long lines as needed. Newline characters appearing in the error message fields should
be treated as paragraph breaks, not line breaks.
Errors generated internally by libpq will have severity and primary message, but typically no
other fields.
996
libpq — C Library
```
Note that error fields are only available from PGresult objects, not PGconn objects; there is
```
no PQerrorField function.
PQclear
Frees the storage associated with a PGresult. Every command result should be freed via PQ-
clear when it is no longer needed.
```
void PQclear(PGresult *res);
```
If the argument is a NULL pointer, no operation is performed.
```
You can keep a PGresult object around for as long as you need it; it does not go away when
```
you issue a new command, nor even if you close the connection. To get rid of it, you must call
PQclear. Failure to do this will result in memory leaks in your application.
32.3.2. Retrieving Query Result Information
These functions are used to extract information from a PGresult object that represents a success-
```
ful query result (that is, one that has status PGRES_TUPLES_OK, PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE, or
```
```
PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK). They can also be used to extract information from a successful Describe
```
```
operation: a Describe's result has all the same column information that actual execution of the query
```
would provide, but it has zero rows. For objects with other status values, these functions will act as
though the result has zero rows and zero columns.
PQntuples
```
Returns the number of rows (tuples) in the query result. (Note that PGresult objects are limited
```
```
to no more than INT_MAX rows, so an int result is sufficient.)
```
```
int PQntuples(const PGresult *res);
```
PQnfields
```
Returns the number of columns (fields) in each row of the query result.
```
```
int PQnfields(const PGresult *res);
```
PQfname
Returns the column name associated with the given column number. Column numbers start at
0. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult
handle is passed to PQclear.
```
char *PQfname(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
NULL is returned if the column number is out of range.
PQfnumber
Returns the column number associated with the given column name.
```
int PQfnumber(const PGresult *res,
```
```
const char *column_name);
```
997
libpq — C Library
-1 is returned if the given name does not match any column.
The given name is treated like an identifier in an SQL command, that is, it is downcased unless
double-quoted. For example, given a query result generated from the SQL command:
```
SELECT 1 AS FOO, 2 AS "BAR";
```
we would have the results:
```
PQfname(res, 0) foo
```
```
PQfname(res, 1) BAR
```
```
PQfnumber(res, "FOO") 0
```
```
PQfnumber(res, "foo") 0
```
```
PQfnumber(res, "BAR") -1
```
```
PQfnumber(res, "\"BAR\"") 1
```
PQftable
Returns the OID of the table from which the given column was fetched. Column numbers start at 0.
```
Oid PQftable(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
InvalidOid is returned if the column number is out of range, or if the specified column is not
a simple reference to a table column. You can query the system table pg_class to determine
exactly which table is referenced.
The type Oid and the constant InvalidOid will be defined when you include the libpq header
file. They will both be some integer type.
PQftablecol
```
Returns the column number (within its table) of the column making up the specified query result
```
column. Query-result column numbers start at 0, but table columns have nonzero numbers.
```
int PQftablecol(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
Zero is returned if the column number is out of range, or if the specified column is not a simple
reference to a table column.
PQfformat
Returns the format code indicating the format of the given column. Column numbers start at 0.
```
int PQfformat(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
Format code zero indicates textual data representation, while format code one indicates binary
```
representation. (Other codes are reserved for future definition.)
```
PQftype
Returns the data type associated with the given column number. The integer returned is the internal
OID number of the type. Column numbers start at 0.
998
libpq — C Library
```
Oid PQftype(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
You can query the system table pg_type to obtain the names and properties of the various data
types. The OIDs of the built-in data types are defined in the file catalog/pg_type_d.h in
the PostgreSQL installation's include directory.
PQfmod
Returns the type modifier of the column associated with the given column number. Column num-
bers start at 0.
```
int PQfmod(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
```
The interpretation of modifier values is type-specific; they typically indicate precision or size
```
limits. The value -1 is used to indicate “no information available”. Most data types do not use
modifiers, in which case the value is always -1.
PQfsize
Returns the size in bytes of the column associated with the given column number. Column num-
bers start at 0.
```
int PQfsize(const PGresult *res,
```
```
int column_number);
```
PQfsize returns the space allocated for this column in a database row, in other words the size
```
of the server's internal representation of the data type. (Accordingly, it is not really very useful to
```
```
clients.) A negative value indicates the data type is variable-length.
```
PQbinaryTuples
Returns 1 if the PGresult contains binary data and 0 if it contains text data.
```
int PQbinaryTuples(const PGresult *res);
```
```
This function is deprecated (except for its use in connection with COPY), because it is possible for
```
a single PGresult to contain text data in some columns and binary data in others. PQfformat
```
is preferred. PQbinaryTuples returns 1 only if all columns of the result are binary (format 1).
```
PQgetvalue
Returns a single field value of one row of a PGresult. Row and column numbers start at 0. The
caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGresult handle
is passed to PQclear.
```
char *PQgetvalue(const PGresult *res,
```
int row_number,
```
int column_number);
```
For data in text format, the value returned by PQgetvalue is a null-terminated character string
representation of the field value. For data in binary format, the value is in the binary representation
```
determined by the data type's typsend and typreceive functions. (The value is actually
```
999
libpq — C Library
followed by a zero byte in this case too, but that is not ordinarily useful, since the value is likely
```
to contain embedded nulls.)
```
An empty string is returned if the field value is null. See PQgetisnull to distinguish null values
from empty-string values.
The pointer returned by PQgetvalue points to storage that is part of the PGresult structure.
One should not modify the data it points to, and one must explicitly copy the data into other
storage if it is to be used past the lifetime of the PGresult structure itself.
PQgetisnull
Tests a field for a null value. Row and column numbers start at 0.
```
int PQgetisnull(const PGresult *res,
```
int row_number,
```
int column_number);
```
```
This function returns 1 if the field is null and 0 if it contains a non-null value. (Note that PQget-
```
```
value will return an empty string, not a null pointer, for a null field.)
```
PQgetlength
Returns the actual length of a field value in bytes. Row and column numbers start at 0.
```
int PQgetlength(const PGresult *res,
```
int row_number,
```
int column_number);
```
This is the actual data length for the particular data value, that is, the size of the object pointed to
```
by PQgetvalue. For text data format this is the same as strlen(). For binary format this is
```
essential information. Note that one should not rely on PQfsize to obtain the actual data length.
PQnparams
Returns the number of parameters of a prepared statement.
```
int PQnparams(const PGresult *res);
```
This function is only useful when inspecting the result of PQdescribePrepared. For other
types of results it will return zero.
PQparamtype
Returns the data type of the indicated statement parameter. Parameter numbers start at 0.
```
Oid PQparamtype(const PGresult *res, int param_number);
```
This function is only useful when inspecting the result of PQdescribePrepared. For other
types of results it will return zero.
PQprint
Prints out all the rows and, optionally, the column names to the specified output stream.
```
void PQprint(FILE *fout, /* output stream */
```
1000
libpq — C Library
const PGresult *res,
```
const PQprintOpt *po);
```
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
pqbool header; /* print output field headings and row
```
count */
```
pqbool align; /* fill align the fields */
```
```
pqbool standard; /* old brain dead format */
```
```
pqbool html3; /* output HTML tables */
```
```
pqbool expanded; /* expand tables */
```
```
pqbool pager; /* use pager for output if needed */
```
```
char *fieldSep; /* field separator */
```
```
char *tableOpt; /* attributes for HTML table element */
```
```
char *caption; /* HTML table caption */
```
```
char **fieldName; /* null-terminated array of replacement
```
field names */
```
} PQprintOpt;
```
This function was formerly used by psql to print query results, but this is no longer the case. Note
that it assumes all the data is in text format.
32.3.3. Retrieving Other Result Information
These functions are used to extract other information from PGresult objects.
PQcmdStatus
Returns the command status tag from the SQL command that generated the PGresult.
```
char *PQcmdStatus(PGresult *res);
```
Commonly this is just the name of the command, but it might include additional data such as the
number of rows processed. The caller should not free the result directly. It will be freed when the
associated PGresult handle is passed to PQclear.
PQcmdTuples
Returns the number of rows affected by the SQL command.
```
char *PQcmdTuples(PGresult *res);
```
This function returns a string containing the number of rows affected by the SQL statement that
generated the PGresult. This function can only be used following the execution of a SELECT,
CREATE TABLE AS, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, MOVE, FETCH, or COPY statement,
or an EXECUTE of a prepared query that contains an INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE
statement. If the command that generated the PGresult was anything else, PQcmdTuples
returns an empty string. The caller should not free the return value directly. It will be freed when
the associated PGresult handle is passed to PQclear.
PQoidValue
Returns the OID of the inserted row, if the SQL command was an INSERT that inserted exactly
one row into a table that has OIDs, or a EXECUTE of a prepared query containing a suitable
INSERT statement. Otherwise, this function returns InvalidOid. This function will also return
InvalidOid if the table affected by the INSERT statement does not contain OIDs.
```
Oid PQoidValue(const PGresult *res);
```
1001
libpq — C Library
PQoidStatus
This function is deprecated in favor of PQoidValue and is not thread-safe. It returns a string
with the OID of the inserted row, while PQoidValue returns the OID value.
```
char *PQoidStatus(const PGresult *res);
```
32.3.4. Escaping Strings for Inclusion in SQL Com-
mands
PQescapeLiteral
```
char *PQescapeLiteral(PGconn *conn, const char *str, size_t
```
```
length);
```
PQescapeLiteral escapes a string for use within an SQL command. This is useful when
```
inserting data values as literal constants in SQL commands. Certain characters (such as quotes
```
```
and backslashes) must be escaped to prevent them from being interpreted specially by the SQL
```
parser. PQescapeLiteral performs this operation.
PQescapeLiteral returns an escaped version of the str parameter in memory allocated with
```
malloc(). This memory should be freed using PQfreemem() when the result is no longer
```
```
needed. A terminating zero byte is not required, and should not be counted in length. (If a
```
terminating zero byte is found before length bytes are processed, PQescapeLiteral stops
```
at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like strncpy.) The return string has all special characters
```
replaced so that they can be properly processed by the PostgreSQL string literal parser. A termi-
nating zero byte is also added. The single quotes that must surround PostgreSQL string literals
are included in the result string.
On error, PQescapeLiteral returns NULL and a suitable message is stored in the conn object.
Tip
It is especially important to do proper escaping when handling strings that were received
from an untrustworthy source. Otherwise there is a security risk: you are vulnerable to
“SQL injection” attacks wherein unwanted SQL commands are fed to your database.
Note that it is neither necessary nor correct to do escaping when a data value is passed as a separate
parameter in PQexecParams or its sibling routines.
PQescapeIdentifier
```
char *PQescapeIdentifier(PGconn *conn, const char *str, size_t
```
```
length);
```
PQescapeIdentifier escapes a string for use as an SQL identifier, such as a table, column,
or function name. This is useful when a user-supplied identifier might contain special characters
that would otherwise not be interpreted as part of the identifier by the SQL parser, or when the
identifier might contain upper case characters whose case should be preserved.
PQescapeIdentifier returns a version of the str parameter escaped as an SQL identifier in
```
memory allocated with malloc(). This memory must be freed using PQfreemem() when the
```
result is no longer needed. A terminating zero byte is not required, and should not be counted in
1002
libpq — C Library
```
length. (If a terminating zero byte is found before length bytes are processed, PQescapeI-
```
```
dentifier stops at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like strncpy.) The return string has
```
all special characters replaced so that it will be properly processed as an SQL identifier. A termi-
nating zero byte is also added. The return string will also be surrounded by double quotes.
On error, PQescapeIdentifier returns NULL and a suitable message is stored in the conn
object.
Tip
As with string literals, to prevent SQL injection attacks, SQL identifiers must be escaped
when they are received from an untrustworthy source.
PQescapeStringConn
```
size_t PQescapeStringConn(PGconn *conn,
```
char *to, const char *from, size_t
length,
```
int *error);
```
PQescapeStringConn escapes string literals, much like PQescapeLiteral. Unlike
PQescapeLiteral, the caller is responsible for providing an appropriately sized buffer. Fur-
thermore, PQescapeStringConn does not generate the single quotes that must surround Post-
```
greSQL string literals; they should be provided in the SQL command that the result is inserted
```
into. The parameter from points to the first character of the string that is to be escaped, and the
length parameter gives the number of bytes in this string. A terminating zero byte is not re-
```
quired, and should not be counted in length. (If a terminating zero byte is found before length
```
```
bytes are processed, PQescapeStringConn stops at the zero; the behavior is thus rather like
```
```
strncpy.) to shall point to a buffer that is able to hold at least one more byte than twice the
```
value of length, otherwise the behavior is undefined. Behavior is likewise undefined if the to
and from strings overlap.
If the error parameter is not NULL, then *error is set to zero on success, nonzero on er-
ror. Presently the only possible error conditions involve invalid multibyte encoding in the source
string. The output string is still generated on error, but it can be expected that the server will
reject it as malformed. On error, a suitable message is stored in the conn object, whether or not
error is NULL.
PQescapeStringConn returns the number of bytes written to to, not including the terminat-
ing zero byte.
PQescapeString
PQescapeString is an older, deprecated version of PQescapeStringConn.
```
size_t PQescapeString (char *to, const char *from, size_t
```
```
length);
```
The only difference from PQescapeStringConn is that PQescapeString does not take
PGconn or error parameters. Because of this, it cannot adjust its behavior depending on the
```
connection properties (such as character encoding) and therefore it might give the wrong results.
```
Also, it has no way to report error conditions.
PQescapeString can be used safely in client programs that work with only one PostgreSQL
```
connection at a time (in this case it can find out what it needs to know “behind the scenes”). In
```
other contexts it is a security hazard and should be avoided in favor of PQescapeStringConn.
1003
libpq — C Library
PQescapeByteaConn
Escapes binary data for use within an SQL command with the type bytea. As with
PQescapeStringConn, this is only used when inserting data directly into an SQL command
string.
```
unsigned char *PQescapeByteaConn(PGconn *conn,
```
const unsigned char *from,
size_t from_length,
```
size_t *to_length);
```
Certain byte values must be escaped when used as part of a bytea literal in an SQL statement.
PQescapeByteaConn escapes bytes using either hex encoding or backslash escaping. See
Section 8.4 for more information.
The from parameter points to the first byte of the string that is to be escaped, and the
```
from_length parameter gives the number of bytes in this binary string. (A terminating zero
```
```
byte is neither necessary nor counted.) The to_length parameter points to a variable that will
```
hold the resultant escaped string length. This result string length includes the terminating zero
byte of the result.
PQescapeByteaConn returns an escaped version of the from parameter binary string in mem-
```
ory allocated with malloc(). This memory should be freed using PQfreemem() when the
```
result is no longer needed. The return string has all special characters replaced so that they can
be properly processed by the PostgreSQL string literal parser, and the bytea input function.
A terminating zero byte is also added. The single quotes that must surround PostgreSQL string
literals are not part of the result string.
On error, a null pointer is returned, and a suitable error message is stored in the conn object.
Currently, the only possible error is insufficient memory for the result string.
PQescapeBytea
PQescapeBytea is an older, deprecated version of PQescapeByteaConn.
```
unsigned char *PQescapeBytea(const unsigned char *from,
```
size_t from_length,
```
size_t *to_length);
```
The only difference from PQescapeByteaConn is that PQescapeBytea does not take a
PGconn parameter. Because of this, PQescapeBytea can only be used safely in client pro-
```
grams that use a single PostgreSQL connection at a time (in this case it can find out what it needs
```
```
to know “behind the scenes”). It might give the wrong results if used in programs that use multiple
```
```
database connections (use PQescapeByteaConn in such cases).
```
PQunescapeBytea
Converts a string representation of binary data into binary data — the reverse of PQescape-
Bytea. This is needed when retrieving bytea data in text format, but not when retrieving it
in binary format.
```
unsigned char *PQunescapeBytea(const unsigned char *from, size_t
```
```
*to_length);
```
The from parameter points to a string such as might be returned by PQgetvalue when applied
to a bytea column. PQunescapeBytea converts this string representation into its binary rep-
```
resentation. It returns a pointer to a buffer allocated with malloc(), or NULL on error, and puts
```
1004
libpq — C Library
the size of the buffer in to_length. The result must be freed using PQfreemem when it is
no longer needed.
This conversion is not exactly the inverse of PQescapeBytea, because the string is not expected
to be “escaped” when received from PQgetvalue. In particular this means there is no need for
string quoting considerations, and so no need for a PGconn parameter.
32.4. Asynchronous Command Processing
The PQexec function is adequate for submitting commands in normal, synchronous applications. It
has a few deficiencies, however, that can be of importance to some users:
• PQexec waits for the command to be completed. The application might have other work to do
```
(such as maintaining a user interface), in which case it won't want to block waiting for the response.
```
• Since the execution of the client application is suspended while it waits for the result, it is hard for
```
the application to decide that it would like to try to cancel the ongoing command. (It can be done
```
```
from a signal handler, but not otherwise.)
```
• PQexec can return only one PGresult structure. If the submitted command string contains mul-
tiple SQL commands, all but the last PGresult are discarded by PQexec.
• PQexec always collects the command's entire result, buffering it in a single PGresult. While
this simplifies error-handling logic for the application, it can be impractical for results containing
many rows.
Applications that do not like these limitations can instead use the underlying functions that PQex-
ec is built from: PQsendQuery and PQgetResult. There are also PQsendQueryParams,
PQsendPrepare, PQsendQueryPrepared, PQsendDescribePrepared, PQsendDe-
scribePortal, PQsendClosePrepared, and PQsendClosePortal, which can be used
with PQgetResult to duplicate the functionality of PQexecParams, PQprepare, PQex-
ecPrepared, PQdescribePrepared, PQdescribePortal, PQclosePrepared, and
PQclosePortal respectively.
PQsendQuery
```
Submits a command to the server without waiting for the result(s). 1 is returned if the command
```
```
was successfully dispatched and 0 if not (in which case, use PQerrorMessage to get more
```
```
information about the failure).
```
```
int PQsendQuery(PGconn *conn, const char *command);
```
After successfully calling PQsendQuery, call PQgetResult one or more times to obtain the
```
results. PQsendQuery cannot be called again (on the same connection) until PQgetResult
```
has returned a null pointer, indicating that the command is done.
In pipeline mode, this function is disallowed.
PQsendQueryParams
```
Submits a command and separate parameters to the server without waiting for the result(s).
```
```
int PQsendQueryParams(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *command,
int nParams,
const Oid *paramTypes,
const char * const *paramValues,
1005
libpq — C Library
const int *paramLengths,
const int *paramFormats,
```
int resultFormat);
```
This is equivalent to PQsendQuery except that query parameters can be specified separately
from the query string. The function's parameters are handled identically to PQexecParams.
Like PQexecParams, it allows only one command in the query string.
PQsendPrepare
Sends a request to create a prepared statement with the given parameters, without waiting for
completion.
```
int PQsendPrepare(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *stmtName,
const char *query,
int nParams,
```
const Oid *paramTypes);
```
This is an asynchronous version of PQprepare: it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch the re-
quest, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call PQgetResult to determine whether the server
successfully created the prepared statement. The function's parameters are handled identically to
PQprepare.
PQsendQueryPrepared
Sends a request to execute a prepared statement with given parameters, without waiting for the
```
result(s).
```
```
int PQsendQueryPrepared(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *stmtName,
int nParams,
const char * const *paramValues,
const int *paramLengths,
const int *paramFormats,
```
int resultFormat);
```
This is similar to PQsendQueryParams, but the command to be executed is specified by nam-
ing a previously-prepared statement, instead of giving a query string. The function's parameters
are handled identically to PQexecPrepared.
PQsendDescribePrepared
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified prepared statement, without waiting
for completion.
```
int PQsendDescribePrepared(PGconn *conn, const char *stmtName);
```
This is an asynchronous version of PQdescribePrepared: it returns 1 if it was able to dis-
patch the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call PQgetResult to obtain the results.
The function's parameters are handled identically to PQdescribePrepared.
PQsendDescribePortal
Submits a request to obtain information about the specified portal, without waiting for completion.
```
int PQsendDescribePortal(PGconn *conn, const char *portalName);
```
1006
libpq — C Library
This is an asynchronous version of PQdescribePortal: it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch
the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call PQgetResult to obtain the results. The
function's parameters are handled identically to PQdescribePortal.
PQsendClosePrepared
Submits a request to close the specified prepared statement, without waiting for completion.
```
int PQsendClosePrepared(PGconn *conn, const char *stmtName);
```
This is an asynchronous version of PQclosePrepared: it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch
the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call PQgetResult to obtain the results. The
function's parameters are handled identically to PQclosePrepared.
PQsendClosePortal
Submits a request to close specified portal, without waiting for completion.
```
int PQsendClosePortal(PGconn *conn, const char *portalName);
```
This is an asynchronous version of PQclosePortal: it returns 1 if it was able to dispatch
the request, and 0 if not. After a successful call, call PQgetResult to obtain the results. The
function's parameters are handled identically to PQclosePortal.
PQgetResult
Waits for the next result from a prior PQsendQuery, PQsendQueryParams,
PQsendPrepare, PQsendQueryPrepared, PQsendDescribePrepared, PQsend-
DescribePortal, PQsendClosePrepared, PQsendClosePortal, PQsend-
PipelineSync, or PQpipelineSync call, and returns it. A null pointer is returned when
the command is complete and there will be no more results.
```
PGresult *PQgetResult(PGconn *conn);
```
PQgetResult must be called repeatedly until it returns a null pointer, indicating that the com-
```
mand is done. (If called when no command is active, PQgetResult will just return a null pointer
```
```
at once.) Each non-null result from PQgetResult should be processed using the same PGre-
```
sult accessor functions previously described. Don't forget to free each result object with PQ-
clear when done with it. Note that PQgetResult will block only if a command is active and
the necessary response data has not yet been read by PQconsumeInput .
```
In pipeline mode, PQgetResult will return normally unless an error occurs; for any subse-
```
```
quent query sent after the one that caused the error until (and excluding) the next synchronization
```
point, a special result of type PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED will be returned, and a null point-
er will be returned after it. When the pipeline synchronization point is reached, a result of type
PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC will be returned. The result of the next query after the synchroniza-
```
tion point follows immediately (that is, no null pointer is returned after the synchronization point).
```
Note
Even when PQresultStatus indicates a fatal error, PQgetResult should be called
until it returns a null pointer, to allow libpq to process the error information completely.
Using PQsendQuery and PQgetResult solves one of PQexec's problems: If a command string
```
contains multiple SQL commands, the results of those commands can be obtained individually. (This
```
1007
libpq — C Library
allows a simple form of overlapped processing, by the way: the client can be handling the results of
```
one command while the server is still working on later queries in the same command string.)
```
Another frequently-desired feature that can be obtained with PQsendQuery and PQgetResult is
retrieving large query results a limited number of rows at a time. This is discussed in Section 32.6.
By itself, calling PQgetResult will still cause the client to block until the server completes the next
SQL command. This can be avoided by proper use of two more functions:
PQconsumeInput
If input is available from the server, consume it.
```
int PQconsumeInput(PGconn *conn);
```
PQconsumeInput normally returns 1 indicating “no error”, but returns 0 if there was some
```
kind of trouble (in which case PQerrorMessage can be consulted). Note that the result does
```
not say whether any input data was actually collected. After calling PQconsumeInput , the
application can check PQisBusy and/or PQnotifies to see if their state has changed.
PQconsumeInput can be called even if the application is not prepared to deal with a result or
notification just yet. The function will read available data and save it in a buffer, thereby causing a
```
select() read-ready indication to go away. The application can thus use PQconsumeInput
```
```
to clear the select() condition immediately, and then examine the results at leisure.
```
PQisBusy
Returns 1 if a command is busy, that is, PQgetResult would block waiting for input. A 0 return
indicates that PQgetResult can be called with assurance of not blocking.
```
int PQisBusy(PGconn *conn);
```
```
PQisBusy will not itself attempt to read data from the server; therefore PQconsumeInput
```
must be invoked first, or the busy state will never end.
```
A typical application using these functions will have a main loop that uses select() or poll()
```
to wait for all the conditions that it must respond to. One of the conditions will be input available
```
from the server, which in terms of select() means readable data on the file descriptor identified
```
by PQsocket. When the main loop detects input ready, it should call PQconsumeInput to read
```
the input. It can then call PQisBusy, followed by PQgetResult if PQisBusy returns false (0).
```
```
It can also call PQnotifies to detect NOTIFY messages (see Section 32.9).
```
A client that uses PQsendQuery/PQgetResult can also attempt to cancel a command that is still
```
being processed by the server; see Section 32.7. But regardless of the return value of PQcancel-
```
Blocking, the application must continue with the normal result-reading sequence using PQgetRe-
sult. A successful cancellation will simply cause the command to terminate sooner than it would
have otherwise.
By using the functions described above, it is possible to avoid blocking while waiting for input from
the database server. However, it is still possible that the application will block waiting to send output to
the server. This is relatively uncommon but can happen if very long SQL commands or data values are
```
sent. (It is much more probable if the application sends data via COPY IN, however.) To prevent this
```
possibility and achieve completely nonblocking database operation, the following additional functions
can be used.
PQsetnonblocking
Sets the nonblocking status of the connection.
1008
libpq — C Library
```
int PQsetnonblocking(PGconn *conn, int arg);
```
Sets the state of the connection to nonblocking if arg is 1, or blocking if arg is 0. Returns 0
if OK, -1 if error.
In the nonblocking state, successful calls to PQsendQuery, PQputline, PQputnbytes,
```
PQputCopyData, and PQendcopy will not block; their changes are stored in the local output
```
buffer until they are flushed. Unsuccessful calls will return an error and must be retried.
```
Note that PQexec does not honor nonblocking mode; if it is called, it will act in blocking fashion
```
anyway.
PQisnonblocking
Returns the blocking status of the database connection.
```
int PQisnonblocking(const PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 if the connection is set to nonblocking mode and 0 if blocking.
PQflush
```
Attempts to flush any queued output data to the server. Returns 0 if successful (or if the send
```
```
queue is empty), -1 if it failed for some reason, or 1 if it was unable to send all the data in the send
```
```
queue yet (this case can only occur if the connection is nonblocking).
```
```
int PQflush(PGconn *conn);
```
After sending any command or data on a nonblocking connection, call PQflush. If it returns 1, wait
for the socket to become read- or write-ready. If it becomes write-ready, call PQflush again. If it
becomes read-ready, call PQconsumeInput , then call PQflush again. Repeat until PQflush
```
returns 0. (It is necessary to check for read-ready and drain the input with PQconsumeInput ,
```
because the server can block trying to send us data, e.g., NOTICE messages, and won't read our data
```
until we read its.) Once PQflush returns 0, wait for the socket to be read-ready and then read the
```
response as described above.
32.5. Pipeline Mode
libpq pipeline mode allows applications to send a query without having to read the result of the pre-
viously sent query. Taking advantage of the pipeline mode, a client will wait less for the server, since
multiple queries/results can be sent/received in a single network transaction.
While pipeline mode provides a significant performance boost, writing clients using the pipeline mode
is more complex because it involves managing a queue of pending queries and finding which result
corresponds to which query in the queue.
Pipeline mode also generally consumes more memory on both the client and server, though careful
and aggressive management of the send/receive queue can mitigate this. This applies whether or not
the connection is in blocking or non-blocking mode.
While libpq's pipeline API was introduced in PostgreSQL 14, it is a client-side feature which doesn't
require special server support and works on any server that supports the v3 extended query protocol.
For more information see Section 54.2.4.
32.5.1. Using Pipeline Mode
To issue pipelines, the application must switch the connection into pipeline mode, which is done with
PQenterPipelineMode. PQpipelineStatus can be used to test whether pipeline mode is
1009
libpq — C Library
active. In pipeline mode, only asynchronous operations that utilize the extended query protocol are
permitted, command strings containing multiple SQL commands are disallowed, and so is COPY. Us-
ing synchronous command execution functions such as PQfn, PQexec, PQexecParams, PQpre-
pare, PQexecPrepared, PQdescribePrepared, PQdescribePortal, PQclosePre-
pared, PQclosePortal, is an error condition. PQsendQuery is also disallowed, because it us-
es the simple query protocol. Once all dispatched commands have had their results processed, and
the end pipeline result has been consumed, the application may return to non-pipelined mode with
PQexitPipelineMode.
Note
It is best to use pipeline mode with libpq in non-blocking mode. If used in blocking mode it
is possible for a client/server deadlock to occur. 4
32.5.1.1. Issuing Queries
After entering pipeline mode, the application dispatches requests using PQsendQueryParams or
its prepared-query sibling PQsendQueryPrepared. These requests are queued on the client-side
```
until flushed to the server; this occurs when PQpipelineSync is used to establish a synchroniza-
```
tion point in the pipeline, or when PQflush is called. The functions PQsendPrepare, PQsend-
DescribePrepared, PQsendDescribePortal, PQsendClosePrepared, and PQsend-
ClosePortal also work in pipeline mode. Result processing is described below.
The server executes statements, and returns results, in the order the client sends them. The serv-
er will begin executing the commands in the pipeline immediately, not waiting for the end of the
```
pipeline. Note that results are buffered on the server side; the server flushes that buffer when a syn-
```
chronization point is established with either PQpipelineSync or PQsendPipelineSync, or
when PQsendFlushRequest is called. If any statement encounters an error, the server aborts the
current transaction and does not execute any subsequent command in the queue until the next synchro-
```
nization point; a PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED result is produced for each such command. (This
```
```
remains true even if the commands in the pipeline would rollback the transaction.) Query processing
```
resumes after the synchronization point.
```
It's fine for one operation to depend on the results of a prior one; for example, one query may define
```
a table that the next query in the same pipeline uses. Similarly, an application may create a named
prepared statement and execute it with later statements in the same pipeline.
32.5.1.2. Processing Results
To process the result of one query in a pipeline, the application calls PQgetResult repeatedly and
handles each result until PQgetResult returns null. The result from the next query in the pipeline
may then be retrieved using PQgetResult again and the cycle repeated. The application handles
individual statement results as normal. When the results of all the queries in the pipeline have been
returned, PQgetResult returns a result containing the status value PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC
The client may choose to defer result processing until the complete pipeline has been sent, or interleave
```
that with sending further queries in the pipeline; see Section 32.5.1.4.
```
PQgetResult behaves the same as for normal asynchronous processing except that it may con-
tain the new PGresult types PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC and PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED.
PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC is reported exactly once for each PQpipelineSync or PQsend-
PipelineSync at the corresponding point in the pipeline. PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED is emit-
4 The client will block trying to send queries to the server, but the server will block trying to send results to the client from queries it has
already processed. This only occurs when the client sends enough queries to fill both its output buffer and the server's receive buffer before it
switches to processing input from the server, but it's hard to predict exactly when that will happen.
1010
libpq — C Library
ted in place of a normal query result for the first error and all subsequent results until the next
```
PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC; see Section 32.5.1.3.
```
PQisBusy, PQconsumeInput, etc operate as normal when processing pipeline results. In partic-
ular, a call to PQisBusy in the middle of a pipeline returns 0 if the results for all the queries issued
so far have been consumed.
libpq does not provide any information to the application about the query currently being processed
```
(except that PQgetResult returns null to indicate that we start returning the results of next query).
```
The application must keep track of the order in which it sent queries, to associate them with their
corresponding results. Applications will typically use a state machine or a FIFO queue for this.
32.5.1.3. Error Handling
From the client's perspective, after PQresultStatus returns PGRES_FATAL_ERROR, the
pipeline is flagged as aborted. PQresultStatus will report a PGRES_PIPELINE_ABORTED re-
sult for each remaining queued operation in an aborted pipeline. The result for PQpipelineSync or
PQsendPipelineSync is reported as PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC to signal the end of the aborted
pipeline and resumption of normal result processing.
The client must process results with PQgetResult during error recovery.
If the pipeline used an implicit transaction, then operations that have already executed are rolled back
and operations that were queued to follow the failed operation are skipped entirely. The same behavior
```
holds if the pipeline starts and commits a single explicit transaction (i.e. the first statement is BEGIN
```
```
and the last is COMMIT) except that the session remains in an aborted transaction state at the end of
```
the pipeline. If a pipeline contains multiple explicit transactions, all transactions that committed prior
to the error remain committed, the currently in-progress transaction is aborted, and all subsequent
operations are skipped completely, including subsequent transactions. If a pipeline synchronization
point occurs with an explicit transaction block in aborted state, the next pipeline will become aborted
immediately unless the next command puts the transaction in normal mode with ROLLBACK.
Note
The client must not assume that work is committed when it sends a COMMIT — only when
the corresponding result is received to confirm the commit is complete. Because errors arrive
asynchronously, the application needs to be able to restart from the last received committed
change and resend work done after that point if something goes wrong.
32.5.1.4. Interleaving Result Processing and Query Dispatch
To avoid deadlocks on large pipelines the client should be structured around a non-blocking event loop
using operating system facilities such as select, poll, WaitForMultipleObjectEx, etc.
The client application should generally maintain a queue of work remaining to be dispatched and
a queue of work that has been dispatched but not yet had its results processed. When the socket is
writable it should dispatch more work. When the socket is readable it should read results and process
them, matching them up to the next entry in its corresponding results queue. Based on available mem-
ory, results from the socket should be read frequently: there's no need to wait until the pipeline end
```
to read the results. Pipelines should be scoped to logical units of work, usually (but not necessarily)
```
one transaction per pipeline. There's no need to exit pipeline mode and re-enter it between pipelines,
or to wait for one pipeline to finish before sending the next.
```
An example using select() and a simple state machine to track sent and received work is in src/
```
test/modules/libpq_pipeline/libpq_pipeline.c in the PostgreSQL source distrib-
ution.
1011
libpq — C Library
32.5.2. Functions Associated with Pipeline Mode
PQpipelineStatus
Returns the current pipeline mode status of the libpq connection.
```
PGpipelineStatus PQpipelineStatus(const PGconn *conn);
```
PQpipelineStatus can return one of the following values:
PQ_PIPELINE_ON
The libpq connection is in pipeline mode.
PQ_PIPELINE_OFF
The libpq connection is not in pipeline mode.
PQ_PIPELINE_ABORTED
The libpq connection is in pipeline mode and an error occurred while processing the cur-
rent pipeline. The aborted flag is cleared when PQgetResult returns a result of type
PGRES_PIPELINE_SYNC.
PQenterPipelineMode
Causes a connection to enter pipeline mode if it is currently idle or already in pipeline mode.
```
int PQenterPipelineMode(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 and has no effect if the connection is not currently idle, i.e., it has
a result ready, or it is waiting for more input from the server, etc. This function does not actually
send anything to the server, it just changes the libpq connection state.
PQexitPipelineMode
Causes a connection to exit pipeline mode if it is currently in pipeline mode with an empty queue
and no pending results.
```
int PQexitPipelineMode(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 for success. Returns 1 and takes no action if not in pipeline mode. If the current state-
ment isn't finished processing, or PQgetResult has not been called to collect results from all
```
previously sent query, returns 0 (in which case, use PQerrorMessage to get more information
```
```
about the failure).
```
PQpipelineSync
Marks a synchronization point in a pipeline by sending a sync message and flushing the send
```
buffer. This serves as the delimiter of an implicit transaction and an error recovery point; see
```
Section 32.5.1.3.
```
int PQpipelineSync(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 if the connection is not in pipeline mode or sending a sync
message failed.
1012
libpq — C Library
PQsendPipelineSync
Marks a synchronization point in a pipeline by sending a sync message without flushing the send
```
buffer. This serves as the delimiter of an implicit transaction and an error recovery point; see
```
Section 32.5.1.3.
```
int PQsendPipelineSync(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 if the connection is not in pipeline mode or sending a sync mes-
```
sage failed. Note that the message is not itself flushed to the server automatically; use PQflush
```
if necessary.
PQsendFlushRequest
Sends a request for the server to flush its output buffer.
```
int PQsendFlushRequest(PGconn *conn);
```
Returns 1 for success. Returns 0 on any failure.
The server flushes its output buffer automatically as a result of PQpipelineSync being called,
```
or on any request when not in pipeline mode; this function is useful to cause the server to flush its
```
output buffer in pipeline mode without establishing a synchronization point. Note that the request
```
is not itself flushed to the server automatically; use PQflush if necessary.
```
32.5.3. When to Use Pipeline Mode
Much like asynchronous query mode, there is no meaningful performance overhead when using
pipeline mode. It increases client application complexity, and extra caution is required to prevent
client/server deadlocks, but pipeline mode can offer considerable performance improvements, in ex-
change for increased memory usage from leaving state around longer.
```
Pipeline mode is most useful when the server is distant, i.e., network latency (“ping time”) is high, and
```
also when many small operations are being performed in rapid succession. There is usually less benefit
in using pipelined commands when each query takes many multiples of the client/server round-trip
time to execute. A 100-statement operation run on a server 300 ms round-trip-time away would take
```
30 seconds in network latency alone without pipelining; with pipelining it may spend as little as 0.3
```
s waiting for results from the server.
Use pipelined commands when your application does lots of small INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
operations that can't easily be transformed into operations on sets, or into a COPY operation.
Pipeline mode is not useful when information from one operation is required by the client to produce
the next operation. In such cases, the client would have to introduce a synchronization point and wait
for a full client/server round-trip to get the results it needs. However, it's often possible to adjust the
client design to exchange the required information server-side. Read-modify-write cycles are espe-
```
cially good candidates; for example:
```
```
BEGIN;
```
```
SELECT x FROM mytable WHERE id = 42 FOR UPDATE;
```
-- result: x=2
-- client adds 1 to x:
```
UPDATE mytable SET x = 3 WHERE id = 42;
```
```
COMMIT;
```
could be much more efficiently done with:
1013
libpq — C Library
```
UPDATE mytable SET x = x + 1 WHERE id = 42;
```
```
Pipelining is less useful, and more complex, when a single pipeline contains multiple transactions (see
```
```
Section 32.5.1.3).
```
32.6. Retrieving Query Results in Chunks
Ordinarily, libpq collects an SQL command's entire result and returns it to the application as a single
PGresult. This can be unworkable for commands that return a large number of rows. For such cases,
applications can use PQsendQuery and PQgetResult in single-row mode or chunked mode. In
```
these modes, result row(s) are returned to the application as they are received from the server, one at
```
a time for single-row mode or in groups for chunked mode.
To enter one of these modes, call PQsetSingleRowMode or PQsetChunkedRowsMode im-
```
mediately after a successful call of PQsendQuery (or a sibling function). This mode selection is
```
effective only for the currently executing query. Then call PQgetResult repeatedly, until it re-
turns null, as documented in Section 32.4. If the query returns any rows, they are returned as one
or more PGresult objects, which look like normal query results except for having status code
PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE for single-row mode or PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK for chunked mode, in-
stead of PGRES_TUPLES_OK. There is exactly one result row in each PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE
object, while a PGRES_TUPLES_CHUNK object contains at least one row but not more than the spec-
ified number of rows per chunk. After the last row, or immediately if the query returns zero rows,
```
a zero-row object with status PGRES_TUPLES_OK is returned; this is the signal that no more rows
```
```
will arrive. (But note that it is still necessary to continue calling PQgetResult until it returns null.)
```
```
All of these PGresult objects will contain the same row description data (column names, types,
```
```
etc.) that an ordinary PGresult object for the query would have. Each object should be freed with
```
PQclear as usual.
When using pipeline mode, single-row or chunked mode needs to be activated for each query in the
pipeline before retrieving results for that query with PQgetResult. See Section 32.5 for more in-
formation.
PQsetSingleRowMode
Select single-row mode for the currently-executing query.
```
int PQsetSingleRowMode(PGconn *conn);
```
This function can only be called immediately after PQsendQuery or one of its sibling functions,
before any other operation on the connection such as PQconsumeInput or PQgetResult. If
called at the correct time, the function activates single-row mode for the current query and returns
1. Otherwise the mode stays unchanged and the function returns 0. In any case, the mode reverts
to normal after completion of the current query.
PQsetChunkedRowsMode
Select chunked mode for the currently-executing query.
```
int PQsetChunkedRowsMode(PGconn *conn, int chunkSize);
```
This function is similar to PQsetSingleRowMode, except that it specifies retrieval of up to
chunkSize rows per PGresult, not necessarily just one row. This function can only be called
immediately after PQsendQuery or one of its sibling functions, before any other operation on
the connection such as PQconsumeInput or PQgetResult. If called at the correct time, the
```
function activates chunked mode for the current query and returns 1. Otherwise the mode stays
```
1014
libpq — C Library
unchanged and the function returns 0. In any case, the mode reverts to normal after completion
of the current query.
Caution
While processing a query, the server may return some rows and then encounter an error, caus-
ing the query to be aborted. Ordinarily, libpq discards any such rows and reports only the er-
ror. But in single-row or chunked mode, some rows may have already been returned to the
application. Hence, the application will see some PGRES_SINGLE_TUPLE or PGRES_TU-
PLES_CHUNK PGresult objects followed by a PGRES_FATAL_ERROR object. For proper
transactional behavior, the application must be designed to discard or undo whatever has been
done with the previously-processed rows, if the query ultimately fails.
32.7. Canceling Queries in Progress
32.7.1. Functions for Sending Cancel Requests
PQcancelCreate
Prepares a connection over which a cancel request can be sent.
```
PGcancelConn *PQcancelCreate(PGconn *conn);
```
PQcancelCreate creates a PGcancelConn object, but it won't instantly start sending a can-
cel request over this connection. A cancel request can be sent over this connection in a blocking
manner using PQcancelBlocking and in a non-blocking manner using PQcancelStart.
The return value can be passed to PQcancelStatus to check if the PGcancelConn object
was created successfully. The PGcancelConn object is an opaque structure that is not meant to
be accessed directly by the application. This PGcancelConn object can be used to cancel the
query that's running on the original connection in a thread-safe way.
Many connection parameters of the original client will be reused when setting up the connection
for the cancel request. Importantly, if the original connection requires encryption of the connection
```
and/or verification of the target host (using sslmode or gssencmode), then the connection
```
for the cancel request is made with these same requirements. Any connection options that are
only used during authentication or after authentication of the client are ignored though, because
cancellation requests do not require authentication and the connection is closed right after the
cancellation request is submitted.
Note that when PQcancelCreate returns a non-null pointer, you must call PQcancelFin-
ish when you are finished with it, in order to dispose of the structure and any associated memory
blocks. This must be done even if the cancel request failed or was abandoned.
PQcancelBlocking
Requests that the server abandons processing of the current command in a blocking manner.
```
int PQcancelBlocking(PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
The request is made over the given PGcancelConn, which needs to be created with PQ-
cancelCreate. The return value of PQcancelBlocking is 1 if the cancel request was suc-
cessfully dispatched and 0 if not. If it was unsuccessful, the error message can be retrieved using
PQcancelErrorMessage .
1015
libpq — C Library
Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, how-
ever. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return
```
an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the
```
```
command), then there will be no visible result at all.
```
PQcancelStart
PQcancelPoll
Requests that the server abandons processing of the current command in a non-blocking manner.
```
int PQcancelStart(PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
```
PostgresPollingStatusType PQcancelPoll(PGcancelConn
```
```
*cancelConn);
```
The request is made over the given PGcancelConn, which needs to be created with PQ-
cancelCreate. The return value of PQcancelStart is 1 if the cancellation request could be
started and 0 if not. If it was unsuccessful, the error message can be retrieved using PQcancel-
ErrorMessage .
If PQcancelStart succeeds, the next stage is to poll libpq so that it can proceed with the
cancel connection sequence. Use PQcancelSocket to obtain the descriptor of the socket un-
```
derlying the database connection. (Caution: do not assume that the socket remains the same
```
```
across PQcancelPoll calls.) Loop thus: If PQcancelPoll(cancelConn) last returned
```
```
PGRES_POLLING_READING, wait until the socket is ready to read (as indicated by select(),
```
```
poll(), or similar system function). Then call PQcancelPoll(cancelConn) again. Con-
```
```
versely, if PQcancelPoll(cancelConn) last returned PGRES_POLLING_WRITING, wait
```
```
until the socket is ready to write, then call PQcancelPoll(cancelConn) again. On the
```
```
first iteration, i.e., if you have yet to call PQcancelPoll(cancelConn), behave as if it last
```
```
returned PGRES_POLLING_WRITING. Continue this loop until PQcancelPoll(cancel-
```
```
Conn) returns PGRES_POLLING_FAILED, indicating the connection procedure has failed, or
```
PGRES_POLLING_OK, indicating cancel request was successfully dispatched.
Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, how-
ever. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return
```
an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the
```
```
command), then there will be no visible result at all.
```
At any time during connection, the status of the connection can be checked by calling PQ-
```
cancelStatus. If this call returns CONNECTION_BAD, then the cancel procedure has failed;
```
if the call returns CONNECTION_OK, then cancel request was successfully dispatched. Both of
these states are equally detectable from the return value of PQcancelPoll, described above.
```
Other states might also occur during (and only during) an asynchronous connection procedure.
```
These indicate the current stage of the connection procedure and might be useful to provide feed-
back to the user for example. These statuses are:
CONNECTION_ALLOCATED
Waiting for a call to PQcancelStart or PQcancelBlocking, to actually open the
socket. This is the connection state right after calling PQcancelCreate or PQcancel-
Reset. No connection to the server has been initiated yet at this point. To actually start
sending the cancel request use PQcancelStart or PQcancelBlocking.
CONNECTION_STARTED
Waiting for connection to be made.
CONNECTION_MADE
```
Connection OK; waiting to send.
```
1016
libpq — C Library
CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE
Waiting for a response from the server.
CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP
Negotiating SSL encryption.
CONNECTION_GSS_STARTUP
Negotiating GSS encryption.
```
Note that, although these constants will remain (in order to maintain compatibility), an application
```
should never rely upon these occurring in a particular order, or at all, or on the status always being
one of these documented values. An application might do something like this:
```
switch(PQcancelStatus(conn))
```
```
{
```
case CONNECTION_STARTED:
```
feedback = "Connecting...";
```
```
break;
```
case CONNECTION_MADE:
```
feedback = "Connected to server...";
```
```
break;
```
.
.
.
```
default:
```
```
feedback = "Connecting...";
```
```
}
```
```
The connect_timeout connection parameter is ignored when using PQcancelPoll; it is
```
the application's responsibility to decide whether an excessive amount of time has elapsed. Oth-
erwise, PQcancelStart followed by a PQcancelPoll loop is equivalent to PQcancel-
Blocking.
PQcancelStatus
Returns the status of the cancel connection.
```
ConnStatusType PQcancelStatus(const PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
The status can be one of a number of values. However, only three of these are seen outside of
an asynchronous cancel procedure: CONNECTION_ALLOCATED, CONNECTION_OK and CON-
NECTION_BAD. The initial state of a PGcancelConn that's successfully created using PQ-
cancelCreate is CONNECTION_ALLOCATED. A cancel request that was successfully dis-
patched has the status CONNECTION_OK. A failed cancel attempt is signaled by status CON-
NECTION_BAD. An OK status will remain so until PQcancelFinish or PQcancelReset
is called.
See the entry for PQcancelStart with regards to other status codes that might be returned.
Successful dispatch of the cancellation is no guarantee that the request will have any effect, how-
ever. If the cancellation is effective, the command being canceled will terminate early and return
```
an error result. If the cancellation fails (say, because the server was already done processing the
```
```
command), then there will be no visible result at all.
```
1017
libpq — C Library
PQcancelSocket
Obtains the file descriptor number of the cancel connection socket to the server.
```
int PQcancelSocket(const PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
```
A valid descriptor will be greater than or equal to 0; a result of -1 indicates that no server connec-
```
tion is currently open. This might change as a result of calling any of the functions in this section
```
on the PGcancelConn (except for PQcancelErrorMessage and PQcancelSocket
```
```
itself).
```
PQcancelErrorMessage
Returns the error message most recently generated by an operation on the cancel connection.
```
char *PQcancelErrorMessage(const PGcancelConn *cancelconn);
```
Nearly all libpq functions that take a PGcancelConn will set a message for PQcancelEr-
rorMessage if they fail. Note that by libpq convention, a nonempty PQcancelErrorMes-
sage result can consist of multiple lines, and will include a trailing newline. The caller should
not free the result directly. It will be freed when the associated PGcancelConn handle is passed
to PQcancelFinish. The result string should not be expected to remain the same across op-
erations on the PGcancelConn structure.
PQcancelFinish
```
Closes the cancel connection (if it did not finish sending the cancel request yet). Also frees mem-
```
ory used by the PGcancelConn object.
```
void PQcancelFinish(PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
```
Note that even if the cancel attempt fails (as indicated by PQcancelStatus), the application
```
should call PQcancelFinish to free the memory used by the PGcancelConn object. The
PGcancelConn pointer must not be used again after PQcancelFinish has been called.
PQcancelReset
Resets the PGcancelConn so it can be reused for a new cancel connection.
```
void PQcancelReset(PGcancelConn *cancelConn);
```
If the PGcancelConn is currently used to send a cancel request, then this connection is closed.
It will then prepare the PGcancelConn object such that it can be used to send a new cancel
request.
This can be used to create one PGcancelConn for a PGconn and reuse it multiple times
throughout the lifetime of the original PGconn.
32.7.2. Obsolete Functions for Sending Cancel Re-
quests
These functions represent older methods of sending cancel requests. Although they still work, they
are deprecated due to not sending the cancel requests in an encrypted manner, even when the original
connection specified sslmode or gssencmode to require encryption. Thus these older methods are
1018
libpq — C Library
heavily discouraged from being used in new code, and it is recommended to change existing code to
use the new functions instead.
PQgetCancel
Creates a data structure containing the information needed to cancel a command using PQcan-
cel.
```
PGcancel *PQgetCancel(PGconn *conn);
```
PQgetCancel creates a PGcancel object given a PGconn connection object. It will return
NULL if the given conn is NULL or an invalid connection. The PGcancel object is an opaque
```
structure that is not meant to be accessed directly by the application; it can only be passed to
```
PQcancel or PQfreeCancel.
PQfreeCancel
Frees a data structure created by PQgetCancel.
```
void PQfreeCancel(PGcancel *cancel);
```
PQfreeCancel frees a data object previously created by PQgetCancel.
PQcancel
PQcancel is a deprecated and insecure variant of PQcancelBlocking, but one that can be
used safely from within a signal handler.
```
int PQcancel(PGcancel *cancel, char *errbuf, int errbufsize);
```
PQcancel only exists because of backwards compatibility reasons. PQcancelBlocking
should be used instead. The only benefit that PQcancel has is that it can be safely invoked from
a signal handler, if the errbuf is a local variable in the signal handler. However, this is generally
not considered a big enough benefit to be worth the security issues that this function has.
The PGcancel object is read-only as far as PQcancel is concerned, so it can also be invoked
from a thread that is separate from the one manipulating the PGconn object.
The return value of PQcancel is 1 if the cancel request was successfully dispatched and 0 if not.
If not, errbuf is filled with an explanatory error message. errbuf must be a char array of size
```
errbufsize (the recommended size is 256 bytes).
```
PQrequestCancel
PQrequestCancel is a deprecated and insecure variant of PQcancelBlocking.
```
int PQrequestCancel(PGconn *conn);
```
PQrequestCancel only exists because of backwards compatibility reasons. PQcancel-
Blocking should be used instead. There is no benefit to using PQrequestCancel over PQ-
cancelBlocking.
Requests that the server abandon processing of the current command. It operates directly on the
```
PGconn object, and in case of failure stores the error message in the PGconn object (whence it
```
```
can be retrieved by PQerrorMessage ). Although the functionality is the same, this approach
```
1019
libpq — C Library
is not safe within multiple-thread programs or signal handlers, since it is possible that overwriting
the PGconn's error message will mess up the operation currently in progress on the connection.
32.8. The Fast-Path Interface
PostgreSQL provides a fast-path interface to send simple function calls to the server.
Tip
This interface is somewhat obsolete, as one can achieve similar performance and greater func-
tionality by setting up a prepared statement to define the function call. Then, executing the
statement with binary transmission of parameters and results substitutes for a fast-path func-
tion call.
The function PQfn requests execution of a server function via the fast-path interface:
```
PGresult *PQfn(PGconn *conn,
```
int fnid,
int *result_buf,
int *result_len,
int result_is_int,
const PQArgBlock *args,
```
int nargs);
```
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
int len;
```
```
int isint;
```
union
```
{
```
```
int *ptr;
```
```
int integer;
```
```
} u;
```
```
} PQArgBlock;
```
The fnid argument is the OID of the function to be executed. args and nargs define the para-
```
meters to be passed to the function; they must match the declared function argument list. When the
```
isint field of a parameter structure is true, the u.integer value is sent to the server as an inte-
```
ger of the indicated length (this must be 2 or 4 bytes); proper byte-swapping occurs. When isint
```
```
is false, the indicated number of bytes at *u.ptr are sent with no processing; the data must be in
```
```
the format expected by the server for binary transmission of the function's argument data type. (The
```
```
declaration of u.ptr as being of type int * is historical; it would be better to consider it void
```
```
*.) result_buf points to the buffer in which to place the function's return value. The caller must
```
```
have allocated sufficient space to store the return value. (There is no check!) The actual result length
```
in bytes will be returned in the integer pointed to by result_len. If a 2- or 4-byte integer result
is expected, set result_is_int to 1, otherwise set it to 0. Setting result_is_int to 1 causes
libpq to byte-swap the value if necessary, so that it is delivered as a proper int value for the client
```
machine; note that a 4-byte integer is delivered into *result_buf for either allowed result size.
```
When result_is_int is 0, the binary-format byte string sent by the server is returned unmodified.
```
(In this case it's better to consider result_buf as being of type void *.)
```
PQfn always returns a valid PGresult pointer, with status PGRES_COMMAND_OK for success or
PGRES_FATAL_ERROR if some problem was encountered. The result status should be checked be-
fore the result is used. The caller is responsible for freeing the PGresult with PQclear when it
is no longer needed.
1020
libpq — C Library
```
To pass a NULL argument to the function, set the len field of that parameter structure to -1; the
```
isint and u fields are then irrelevant.
If the function returns NULL, *result_len is set to -1, and *result_buf is not modified.
Note that it is not possible to handle set-valued results when using this interface. Also, the function
must be a plain function, not an aggregate, window function, or procedure.
32.9. Asynchronous Notification
PostgreSQL offers asynchronous notification via the LISTEN and NOTIFY commands. A client ses-
```
sion registers its interest in a particular notification channel with the LISTEN command (and can stop
```
```
listening with the UNLISTEN command). All sessions listening on a particular channel will be noti-
```
fied asynchronously when a NOTIFY command with that channel name is executed by any session.
A “payload” string can be passed to communicate additional data to the listeners.
libpq applications submit LISTEN, UNLISTEN, and NOTIFY commands as ordinary SQL com-
mands. The arrival of NOTIFY messages can subsequently be detected by calling PQnotifies.
The function PQnotifies returns the next notification from a list of unhandled notification mes-
sages received from the server. It returns a null pointer if there are no pending notifications. Once a
notification is returned from PQnotifies, it is considered handled and will be removed from the
list of notifications.
```
PGnotify *PQnotifies(PGconn *conn);
```
typedef struct pgNotify
```
{
```
```
char *relname; /* notification channel name */
```
```
int be_pid; /* process ID of notifying server
```
process */
```
char *extra; /* notification payload string */
```
```
} PGnotify;
```
After processing a PGnotify object returned by PQnotifies, be sure to free it with PQfreemem.
```
It is sufficient to free the PGnotify pointer; the relname and extra fields do not represent sep-
```
```
arate allocations. (The names of these fields are historical; in particular, channel names need not have
```
```
anything to do with relation names.)
```
Example 32.2 gives a sample program that illustrates the use of asynchronous notification.
```
PQnotifies does not actually read data from the server; it just returns messages previously absorbed
```
by another libpq function. In ancient releases of libpq, the only way to ensure timely receipt of NOTIFY
messages was to constantly submit commands, even empty ones, and then check PQnotifies after
each PQexec. While this still works, it is deprecated as a waste of processing power.
A better way to check for NOTIFY messages when you have no useful commands to execute is to
```
call PQconsumeInput , then check PQnotifies. You can use select() to wait for data to
```
```
arrive from the server, thereby using no CPU power unless there is something to do. (See PQsocket
```
```
to obtain the file descriptor number to use with select().) Note that this will work OK whether
```
you submit commands with PQsendQuery/PQgetResult or simply use PQexec. You should,
however, remember to check PQnotifies after each PQgetResult or PQexec, to see if any
notifications came in during the processing of the command.
32.10. Functions Associated with the COPY
Command
1021
libpq — C Library
The COPY command in PostgreSQL has options to read from or write to the network connection used
by libpq. The functions described in this section allow applications to take advantage of this capability
by supplying or consuming copied data.
The overall process is that the application first issues the SQL COPY command via PQexec or one of
```
the equivalent functions. The response to this (if there is no error in the command) will be a PGre-
```
```
sult object bearing a status code of PGRES_COPY_OUT or PGRES_COPY_IN (depending on the
```
```
specified copy direction). The application should then use the functions of this section to receive
```
or transmit data rows. When the data transfer is complete, another PGresult object is returned to
indicate success or failure of the transfer. Its status will be PGRES_COMMAND_OK for success or
PGRES_FATAL_ERROR if some problem was encountered. At this point further SQL commands can
```
be issued via PQexec. (It is not possible to execute other SQL commands using the same connection
```
```
while the COPY operation is in progress.)
```
If a COPY command is issued via PQexec in a string that could contain additional commands, the
application must continue fetching results via PQgetResult after completing the COPY sequence.
Only when PQgetResult returns NULL is it certain that the PQexec command string is done and
it is safe to issue more commands.
The functions of this section should be executed only after obtaining a result status of
PGRES_COPY_OUT or PGRES_COPY_IN from PQexec or PQgetResult.
A PGresult object bearing one of these status values carries some additional data about the COPY
operation that is starting. This additional data is available using functions that are also used in con-
nection with query results:
PQnfields
```
Returns the number of columns (fields) to be copied.
```
PQbinaryTuples
```
0 indicates the overall copy format is textual (rows separated by newlines, columns separated
```
```
by separator characters, etc.). 1 indicates the overall copy format is binary. See COPY for more
```
information.
PQfformat
```
Returns the format code (0 for text, 1 for binary) associated with each column of the copy oper-
```
ation. The per-column format codes will always be zero when the overall copy format is textual,
```
but the binary format can support both text and binary columns. (However, as of the current im-
```
```
plementation of COPY, only binary columns appear in a binary copy; so the per-column formats
```
```
always match the overall format at present.)
```
32.10.1. Functions for Sending COPY Data
These functions are used to send data during COPY FROM STDIN. They will fail if called when the
connection is not in COPY_IN state.
PQputCopyData
Sends data to the server during COPY_IN state.
```
int PQputCopyData(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *buffer,
```
int nbytes);
```
Transmits the COPY data in the specified buffer, of length nbytes, to the server. The result
```
is 1 if the data was queued, zero if it was not queued because of full buffers (this will only happen
```
1022
libpq — C Library
```
in nonblocking mode), or -1 if an error occurred. (Use PQerrorMessage to retrieve details if
```
```
the return value is -1. If the value is zero, wait for write-ready and try again.)
```
The application can divide the COPY data stream into buffer loads of any convenient size. Buffer-
load boundaries have no semantic significance when sending. The contents of the data stream
```
must match the data format expected by the COPY command; see COPY for details.
```
PQputCopyEnd
Sends end-of-data indication to the server during COPY_IN state.
```
int PQputCopyEnd(PGconn *conn,
```
```
const char *errormsg);
```
Ends the COPY_IN operation successfully if errormsg is NULL. If errormsg is not NULL
then the COPY is forced to fail, with the string pointed to by errormsg used as the error message.
```
(One should not assume that this exact error message will come back from the server, however,
```
```
as the server might have already failed the COPY for its own reasons.)
```
```
The result is 1 if the termination message was sent; or in nonblocking mode, this may only indi-
```
```
cate that the termination message was successfully queued. (In nonblocking mode, to be certain
```
that the data has been sent, you should next wait for write-ready and call PQflush, repeating
```
until it returns zero.) Zero indicates that the function could not queue the termination message
```
```
because of full buffers; this will only happen in nonblocking mode. (In this case, wait for write-
```
```
ready and try the PQputCopyEnd call again.) If a hard error occurs, -1 is returned; you can use
```
PQerrorMessage to retrieve details.
After successfully calling PQputCopyEnd, call PQgetResult to obtain the final result status
of the COPY command. One can wait for this result to be available in the usual way. Then return
to normal operation.
32.10.2. Functions for Receiving COPY Data
These functions are used to receive data during COPY TO STDOUT. They will fail if called when
the connection is not in COPY_OUT state.
PQgetCopyData
Receives data from the server during COPY_OUT state.
```
int PQgetCopyData(PGconn *conn,
```
char **buffer,
```
int async);
```
Attempts to obtain another row of data from the server during a COPY. Data is always returned
```
one data row at a time; if only a partial row is available, it is not returned. Successful return of a
```
data row involves allocating a chunk of memory to hold the data. The buffer parameter must be
non-NULL. *buffer is set to point to the allocated memory, or to NULL in cases where no buffer
is returned. A non-NULL result buffer should be freed using PQfreemem when no longer needed.
```
When a row is successfully returned, the return value is the number of data bytes in the row (this
```
```
will always be greater than zero). The returned string is always null-terminated, though this is
```
probably only useful for textual COPY. A result of zero indicates that the COPY is still in progress,
```
but no row is yet available (this is only possible when async is true). A result of -1 indicates that
```
```
the COPY is done. A result of -2 indicates that an error occurred (consult PQerrorMessage
```
```
for the reason).
```
```
When async is true (not zero), PQgetCopyData will not block waiting for input; it will return
```
```
zero if the COPY is still in progress but no complete row is available. (In this case wait for read-
```
1023
libpq — C Library
```
ready and then call PQconsumeInput before calling PQgetCopyData again.) When async
```
```
is false (zero), PQgetCopyData will block until data is available or the operation completes.
```
After PQgetCopyData returns -1, call PQgetResult to obtain the final result status of the
COPY command. One can wait for this result to be available in the usual way. Then return to
normal operation.
32.10.3. Obsolete Functions for COPY
These functions represent older methods of handling COPY. Although they still work, they are depre-
cated due to poor error handling, inconvenient methods of detecting end-of-data, and lack of support
for binary or nonblocking transfers.
PQgetline
```
Reads a newline-terminated line of characters (transmitted by the server) into a buffer string of
```
size length.
```
int PQgetline(PGconn *conn,
```
char *buffer,
```
int length);
```
This function copies up to length-1 characters into the buffer and converts the terminating
newline into a zero byte. PQgetline returns EOF at the end of input, 0 if the entire line has
been read, and 1 if the buffer is full but the terminating newline has not yet been read.
Note that the application must check to see if a new line consists of the two characters \., which
indicates that the server has finished sending the results of the COPY command. If the application
might receive lines that are more than length-1 characters long, care is needed to be sure it
```
recognizes the \. line correctly (and does not, for example, mistake the end of a long data line
```
```
for a terminator line).
```
PQgetlineAsync
```
Reads a row of COPY data (transmitted by the server) into a buffer without blocking.
```
```
int PQgetlineAsync(PGconn *conn,
```
char *buffer,
```
int bufsize);
```
This function is similar to PQgetline, but it can be used by applications that must read COPY
data asynchronously, that is, without blocking. Having issued the COPY command and gotten
a PGRES_COPY_OUT response, the application should call PQconsumeInput and PQget-
lineAsync until the end-of-data signal is detected.
Unlike PQgetline, this function takes responsibility for detecting end-of-data.
On each call, PQgetlineAsync will return data if a complete data row is available in libpq's
input buffer. Otherwise, no data is returned until the rest of the row arrives. The function returns
-1 if the end-of-copy-data marker has been recognized, or 0 if no data is available, or a positive
number giving the number of bytes of data returned. If -1 is returned, the caller must next call
PQendcopy, and then return to normal processing.
The data returned will not extend beyond a data-row boundary. If possible a whole row will be
returned at one time. But if the buffer offered by the caller is too small to hold a row sent by the
server, then a partial data row will be returned. With textual data this can be detected by testing
```
whether the last returned byte is \n or not. (In a binary COPY, actual parsing of the COPY data
```
1024
libpq — C Library
```
format will be needed to make the equivalent determination.) The returned string is not null-
```
```
terminated. (If you want to add a terminating null, be sure to pass a bufsize one smaller than
```
```
the room actually available.)
```
PQputline
Sends a null-terminated string to the server. Returns 0 if OK and EOF if unable to send the string.
```
int PQputline(PGconn *conn,
```
```
const char *string);
```
The COPY data stream sent by a series of calls to PQputline has the same format as that returned
by PQgetlineAsync, except that applications are not obliged to send exactly one data row per
```
PQputline call; it is okay to send a partial line or multiple lines per call.
```
Note
Before PostgreSQL protocol 3.0, it was necessary for the application to explicitly send
the two characters \. as a final line to indicate to the server that it had finished sending
COPY data. While this still works, it is deprecated and the special meaning of \. can be
```
expected to be removed in a future release. (It already will misbehave in CSV mode.) It is
```
sufficient to call PQendcopy after having sent the actual data.
PQputnbytes
Sends a non-null-terminated string to the server. Returns 0 if OK and EOF if unable to send the
string.
```
int PQputnbytes(PGconn *conn,
```
const char *buffer,
```
int nbytes);
```
This is exactly like PQputline, except that the data buffer need not be null-terminated since
the number of bytes to send is specified directly. Use this procedure when sending binary data.
PQendcopy
Synchronizes with the server.
```
int PQendcopy(PGconn *conn);
```
This function waits until the server has finished the copying. It should either be issued when the
last string has been sent to the server using PQputline or when the last string has been received
from the server using PQgetline. It must be issued or the server will get “out of sync” with
the client. Upon return from this function, the server is ready to receive the next SQL command.
```
The return value is 0 on successful completion, nonzero otherwise. (Use PQerrorMessage to
```
```
retrieve details if the return value is nonzero.)
```
When using PQgetResult, the application should respond to a PGRES_COPY_OUT result by
executing PQgetline repeatedly, followed by PQendcopy after the terminator line is seen.
It should then return to the PQgetResult loop until PQgetResult returns a null pointer.
Similarly a PGRES_COPY_IN result is processed by a series of PQputline calls followed by
PQendcopy, then return to the PQgetResult loop. This arrangement will ensure that a COPY
command embedded in a series of SQL commands will be executed correctly.
1025
libpq — C Library
Older applications are likely to submit a COPY via PQexec and assume that the transaction is
done after PQendcopy. This will work correctly only if the COPY is the only SQL command
in the command string.
32.11. Control Functions
These functions control miscellaneous details of libpq's behavior.
PQclientEncoding
Returns the client encoding.
```
int PQclientEncoding(const PGconn *conn);
```
Note that it returns the encoding ID, not a symbolic string such as EUC_JP. If unsuccessful, it
returns -1. To convert an encoding ID to an encoding name, you can use:
```
char *pg_encoding_to_char(int encoding_id);
```
PQsetClientEncoding
Sets the client encoding.
```
int PQsetClientEncoding(PGconn *conn, const char *encoding);
```
conn is a connection to the server, and encoding is the encoding you want to use. If the function
successfully sets the encoding, it returns 0, otherwise -1. The current encoding for this connection
can be determined by using PQclientEncoding.
PQsetErrorVerbosity
Determines the verbosity of messages returned by PQerrorMessage and PQresultEr-
rorMessage.
typedef enum
```
{
```
PQERRORS_TERSE,
PQERRORS_DEFAULT,
PQERRORS_VERBOSE,
PQERRORS_SQLSTATE
```
} PGVerbosity;
```
```
PGVerbosity PQsetErrorVerbosity(PGconn *conn, PGVerbosity
```
```
verbosity);
```
PQsetErrorVerbosity sets the verbosity mode, returning the connection's previous setting.
```
In TERSE mode, returned messages include severity, primary text, and position only; this will
```
normally fit on a single line. The DEFAULT mode produces messages that include the above plus
```
any detail, hint, or context fields (these might span multiple lines). The VERBOSE mode includes
```
all available fields. The SQLSTATE mode includes only the error severity and the SQLSTATE
```
error code, if one is available (if not, the output is like TERSE mode).
```
Changing the verbosity setting does not affect the messages available from already-exist-
```
ing PGresult objects, only subsequently-created ones. (But see PQresultVerboseEr-
```
```
rorMessage if you want to print a previous error with a different verbosity.)
```
1026
libpq — C Library
PQsetErrorContextVisibility
Determines the handling of CONTEXT fields in messages returned by PQerrorMessage and
PQresultErrorMessage.
typedef enum
```
{
```
PQSHOW_CONTEXT_NEVER,
PQSHOW_CONTEXT_ERRORS,
PQSHOW_CONTEXT_ALWAYS
```
} PGContextVisibility;
```
```
PGContextVisibility PQsetErrorContextVisibility(PGconn *conn,
```
```
PGContextVisibility show_context);
```
PQsetErrorContextVisibility sets the context display mode, returning the connection's
previous setting. This mode controls whether the CONTEXT field is included in messages. The
NEVER mode never includes CONTEXT, while ALWAYS always includes it if available. In ER-
```
RORS mode (the default), CONTEXT fields are included only in error messages, not in notices
```
```
and warnings. (However, if the verbosity setting is TERSE or SQLSTATE, CONTEXT fields are
```
```
omitted regardless of the context display mode.)
```
Changing this mode does not affect the messages available from already-existing PGresult
```
objects, only subsequently-created ones. (But see PQresultVerboseErrorMessage if you
```
```
want to print a previous error with a different display mode.)
```
PQtrace
Enables tracing of the client/server communication to a debugging file stream.
```
void PQtrace(PGconn *conn, FILE *stream);
```
```
Each line consists of: an optional timestamp, a direction indicator (F for messages from client to
```
```
server or B for messages from server to client), message length, message type, and message con-
```
```
tents. Non-message contents fields (timestamp, direction, length and message type) are separated
```
by a tab. Message contents are separated by a space. Protocol strings are enclosed in double quotes,
while strings used as data values are enclosed in single quotes. Non-printable chars are printed as
hexadecimal escapes. Further message-type-specific detail can be found in Section 54.7.
Note
On Windows, if the libpq library and an application are compiled with different flags, this
```
function call will crash the application because the internal representation of the FILE
```
pointers differ. Specifically, multithreaded/single-threaded, release/debug, and static/dy-
namic flags should be the same for the library and all applications using that library.
PQsetTraceFlags
Controls the tracing behavior of client/server communication.
```
void PQsetTraceFlags(PGconn *conn, int flags);
```
flags contains flag bits describing the operating mode of tracing. If flags contains PQ-
TRACE_SUPPRESS_TIMESTAMPS, then the timestamp is not included when printing each mes-
1027
libpq — C Library
sage. If flags contains PQTRACE_REGRESS_MODE, then some fields are redacted when print-
ing each message, such as object OIDs, to make the output more convenient to use in testing
frameworks. This function must be called after calling PQtrace.
PQuntrace
Disables tracing started by PQtrace.
```
void PQuntrace(PGconn *conn);
```
32.12. Miscellaneous Functions
As always, there are some functions that just don't fit anywhere.
PQfreemem
Frees memory allocated by libpq.
```
void PQfreemem(void *ptr);
```
Frees memory allocated by libpq, particularly PQescapeByteaConn, PQescapeBytea,
PQunescapeBytea, and PQnotifies. It is particularly important that this function, rather
```
than free(), be used on Microsoft Windows. This is because allocating memory in a DLL and
```
releasing it in the application works only if multithreaded/single-threaded, release/debug, and
static/dynamic flags are the same for the DLL and the application. On non-Microsoft Windows
```
platforms, this function is the same as the standard library function free().
```
PQconninfoFree
Frees the data structures allocated by PQconndefaults or PQconninfoParse.
```
void PQconninfoFree(PQconninfoOption *connOptions);
```
If the argument is a NULL pointer, no operation is performed.
A simple PQfreemem will not do for this, since the array contains references to subsidiary
strings.
PQencryptPasswordConn
Prepares the encrypted form of a PostgreSQL password.
```
char *PQencryptPasswordConn(PGconn *conn, const char *passwd,
```
```
const char *user, const char *algorithm);
```
This function is intended to be used by client applications that wish to send commands like ALTER
USER joe PASSWORD 'pwd'. It is good practice not to send the original cleartext password
in such a command, because it might be exposed in command logs, activity displays, and so on.
Instead, use this function to convert the password to encrypted form before it is sent.
The passwd and user arguments are the cleartext password, and the SQL name of the user it
is for. algorithm specifies the encryption algorithm to use to encrypt the password. Currently
```
supported algorithms are md5 and scram-sha-256 (on and off are also accepted as aliases
```
```
for md5, for compatibility with older server versions). Note that support for scram-sha-256
```
was introduced in PostgreSQL version 10, and will not work correctly with older server versions.
1028
libpq — C Library
If algorithm is NULL, this function will query the server for the current value of the pass-
word_encryption setting. That can block, and will fail if the current transaction is aborted, or
if the connection is busy executing another query. If you wish to use the default algorithm for
the server but want to avoid blocking, query password_encryption yourself before calling
PQencryptPasswordConn, and pass that value as the algorithm.
The return value is a string allocated by malloc. The caller can assume the string doesn't contain
any special characters that would require escaping. Use PQfreemem to free the result when done
with it. On error, returns NULL, and a suitable message is stored in the connection object.
PQchangePassword
Changes a PostgreSQL password.
```
PGresult *PQchangePassword(PGconn *conn, const char *user, const
```
```
char *passwd);
```
This function uses PQencryptPasswordConn to build and execute the command ALTER
USER ... PASSWORD '...', thereby changing the user's password. It exists for the same
reason as PQencryptPasswordConn, but is more convenient as it both builds and runs the
command for you. PQencryptPasswordConn is passed a NULL for the algorithm argument,
hence encryption is done according to the server's password_encryption setting.
The user and passwd arguments are the SQL name of the target user, and the new cleartext
password.
Returns a PGresult pointer representing the result of the ALTER USER command, or a null
pointer if the routine failed before issuing any command. The PQresultStatus function
```
should be called to check the return value for any errors (including the value of a null pointer,
```
```
in which case it will return PGRES_FATAL_ERROR). Use PQerrorMessage to get more
```
information about such errors.
PQencryptPassword
Prepares the md5-encrypted form of a PostgreSQL password.
```
char *PQencryptPassword(const char *passwd, const char *user);
```
PQencryptPassword is an older, deprecated version of PQencryptPasswordConn. The
difference is that PQencryptPassword does not require a connection object, and md5 is al-
ways used as the encryption algorithm.
PQmakeEmptyPGresult
Constructs an empty PGresult object with the given status.
```
PGresult *PQmakeEmptyPGresult(PGconn *conn, ExecStatusType
```
```
status);
```
This is libpq's internal function to allocate and initialize an empty PGresult object. This func-
tion returns NULL if memory could not be allocated. It is exported because some applications find
```
it useful to generate result objects (particularly objects with error status) themselves. If conn is
```
not null and status indicates an error, the current error message of the specified connection
is copied into the PGresult. Also, if conn is not null, any event procedures registered in the
```
connection are copied into the PGresult. (They do not get PGEVT_RESULTCREATE calls, but
```
```
see PQfireResultCreateEvents.) Note that PQclear should eventually be called on the
```
object, just as with a PGresult returned by libpq itself.
1029
libpq — C Library
PQfireResultCreateEvents
```
Fires a PGEVT_RESULTCREATE event (see Section 32.14) for each event procedure registered
```
in the PGresult object. Returns non-zero for success, zero if any event procedure fails.
```
int PQfireResultCreateEvents(PGconn *conn, PGresult *res);
```
The conn argument is passed through to event procedures but not used directly. It can be NULL
if the event procedures won't use it.
Event procedures that have already received a PGEVT_RESULTCREATE or PGEVT_RESULT-
COPY event for this object are not fired again.
The main reason that this function is separate from PQmakeEmptyPGresult is that it is often
appropriate to create a PGresult and fill it with data before invoking the event procedures.
PQcopyResult
Makes a copy of a PGresult object. The copy is not linked to the source result in any way
and PQclear must be called when the copy is no longer needed. If the function fails, NULL is
returned.
```
PGresult *PQcopyResult(const PGresult *src, int flags);
```
This is not intended to make an exact copy. The returned result is always put into PGRES_TU-
```
PLES_OK status, and does not copy any error message in the source. (It does copy the com-
```
```
mand status string, however.) The flags argument determines what else is copied. It is a bit-
```
wise OR of several flags. PG_COPYRES_ATTRS specifies copying the source result's attribut-
```
es (column definitions). PG_COPYRES_TUPLES specifies copying the source result's tuples.
```
```
(This implies copying the attributes, too.) PG_COPYRES_NOTICEHOOKS specifies copying the
```
source result's notify hooks. PG_COPYRES_EVENTS specifies copying the source result's events.
```
(But any instance data associated with the source is not copied.) The event procedures receive
```
PGEVT_RESULTCOPY events.
PQsetResultAttrs
Sets the attributes of a PGresult object.
```
int PQsetResultAttrs(PGresult *res, int numAttributes,
```
```
PGresAttDesc *attDescs);
```
The provided attDescs are copied into the result. If the attDescs pointer is NULL or nu-
mAttributes is less than one, the request is ignored and the function succeeds. If res already
contains attributes, the function will fail. If the function fails, the return value is zero. If the func-
tion succeeds, the return value is non-zero.
PQsetvalue
Sets a tuple field value of a PGresult object.
```
int PQsetvalue(PGresult *res, int tup_num, int field_num, char
```
```
*value, int len);
```
The function will automatically grow the result's internal tuples array as needed. However, the
tup_num argument must be less than or equal to PQntuples, meaning this function can only
grow the tuples array one tuple at a time. But any field of any existing tuple can be modified in
any order. If a value at field_num already exists, it will be overwritten. If len is -1 or value
1030
libpq — C Library
is NULL, the field value will be set to an SQL null value. The value is copied into the result's
private storage, thus is no longer needed after the function returns. If the function fails, the return
value is zero. If the function succeeds, the return value is non-zero.
PQresultAlloc
Allocate subsidiary storage for a PGresult object.
```
void *PQresultAlloc(PGresult *res, size_t nBytes);
```
Any memory allocated with this function will be freed when res is cleared. If the function fails,
the return value is NULL. The result is guaranteed to be adequately aligned for any type of data,
just as for malloc.
PQresultMemorySize
Retrieves the number of bytes allocated for a PGresult object.
```
size_t PQresultMemorySize(const PGresult *res);
```
This value is the sum of all malloc requests associated with the PGresult object, that is,
all the memory that will be freed by PQclear. This information can be useful for managing
memory consumption.
PQlibVersion
Return the version of libpq that is being used.
```
int PQlibVersion(void);
```
The result of this function can be used to determine, at run time, whether specific functionality
is available in the currently loaded version of libpq. The function can be used, for example, to
determine which connection options are available in PQconnectdb.
The result is formed by multiplying the library's major version number by 10000 and adding the
minor version number. For example, version 10.1 will be returned as 100001, and version 11.0
will be returned as 110000.
Prior to major version 10, PostgreSQL used three-part version numbers in which the first two parts
together represented the major version. For those versions, PQlibVersion uses two digits for
```
each part; for example version 9.1.5 will be returned as 90105, and version 9.2.0 will be returned
```
as 90200.
Therefore, for purposes of determining feature compatibility, applications should divide the result
of PQlibVersion by 100 not 10000 to determine a logical major version number. In all release
```
series, only the last two digits differ between minor releases (bug-fix releases).
```
Note
This function appeared in PostgreSQL version 9.1, so it cannot be used to detect required
functionality in earlier versions, since calling it will create a link dependency on version
9.1 or later.
PQgetCurrentTimeUSec
```
Retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of microseconds since the Unix epoch (that
```
```
is, time_t times 1 million).
```
1031
libpq — C Library
```
pg_usec_time_t PQgetCurrentTimeUSec(void);
```
This is primarily useful for calculating timeout values to use with PQsocketPoll.
32.13. Notice Processing
Notice and warning messages generated by the server are not returned by the query execution func-
tions, since they do not imply failure of the query. Instead they are passed to a notice handling func-
tion, and execution continues normally after the handler returns. The default notice handling function
prints the message on stderr, but the application can override this behavior by supplying its own
handling function.
For historical reasons, there are two levels of notice handling, called the notice receiver and notice
processor. The default behavior is for the notice receiver to format the notice and pass a string to the
notice processor for printing. However, an application that chooses to provide its own notice receiver
will typically ignore the notice processor layer and just do all the work in the notice receiver.
The function PQsetNoticeReceiver sets or examines the current notice receiver for a connec-
tion object. Similarly, PQsetNoticeProcessor sets or examines the current notice processor.
```
typedef void (*PQnoticeReceiver) (void *arg, const PGresult *res);
```
PQnoticeReceiver
```
PQsetNoticeReceiver(PGconn *conn,
```
PQnoticeReceiver proc,
```
void *arg);
```
```
typedef void (*PQnoticeProcessor) (void *arg, const char *message);
```
PQnoticeProcessor
```
PQsetNoticeProcessor(PGconn *conn,
```
PQnoticeProcessor proc,
```
void *arg);
```
Each of these functions returns the previous notice receiver or processor function pointer, and sets the
new value. If you supply a null function pointer, no action is taken, but the current pointer is returned.
When a notice or warning message is received from the server, or generated internally by libpq, the no-
tice receiver function is called. It is passed the message in the form of a PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR
```
PGresult. (This allows the receiver to extract individual fields using PQresultErrorField,
```
or obtain a complete preformatted message using PQresultErrorMessage or PQresultVer-
```
boseErrorMessage.) The same void pointer passed to PQsetNoticeReceiver is also passed.
```
```
(This pointer can be used to access application-specific state if needed.)
```
```
The default notice receiver simply extracts the message (using PQresultErrorMessage) and
```
passes it to the notice processor.
The notice processor is responsible for handling a notice or warning message given in text form. It is
```
passed the string text of the message (including a trailing newline), plus a void pointer that is the same
```
```
one passed to PQsetNoticeProcessor. (This pointer can be used to access application-specific
```
```
state if needed.)
```
The default notice processor is simply:
static void
```
defaultNoticeProcessor(void *arg, const char *message)
```
1032
libpq — C Library
```
{
```
```
fprintf(stderr, "%s", message);
```
```
}
```
Once you have set a notice receiver or processor, you should expect that that function could be called
as long as either the PGconn object or PGresult objects made from it exist. At creation of a PGre-
sult, the PGconn's current notice handling pointers are copied into the PGresult for possible use
by functions like PQgetvalue.
32.14. Event System
libpq's event system is designed to notify registered event handlers about interesting libpq events, such
as the creation or destruction of PGconn and PGresult objects. A principal use case is that this
allows applications to associate their own data with a PGconn or PGresult and ensure that that
data is freed at an appropriate time.
Each registered event handler is associated with two pieces of data, known to libpq only as opaque
void * pointers. There is a pass-through pointer that is provided by the application when the event
handler is registered with a PGconn. The pass-through pointer never changes for the life of the PG-
```
conn and all PGresults generated from it; so if used, it must point to long-lived data. In addi-
```
tion there is an instance data pointer, which starts out NULL in every PGconn and PGresult.
This pointer can be manipulated using the PQinstanceData, PQsetInstanceData, PQre-
sultInstanceData and PQresultSetInstanceData functions. Note that unlike the pass-
through pointer, instance data of a PGconn is not automatically inherited by PGresults created
```
from it. libpq does not know what pass-through and instance data pointers point to (if anything) and
```
will never attempt to free them — that is the responsibility of the event handler.
32.14.1. Event Types
The enum PGEventId names the types of events handled by the event system. All its values have
names beginning with PGEVT. For each event type, there is a corresponding event info structure that
carries the parameters passed to the event handlers. The event types are:
PGEVT_REGISTER
The register event occurs when PQregisterEventProc is called. It is the ideal time to ini-
tialize any instanceData an event procedure may need. Only one register event will be fired
```
per event handler per connection. If the event procedure fails (returns zero), the registration is
```
canceled.
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
PGconn *conn;
```
```
} PGEventRegister;
```
When a PGEVT_REGISTER event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to a
PGEventRegister *. This structure contains a PGconn that should be in the CONNEC-
```
TION_OK status; guaranteed if one calls PQregisterEventProc right after obtaining a good
```
PGconn. When returning a failure code, all cleanup must be performed as no PGEVT_CON-
NDESTROY event will be sent.
PGEVT_CONNRESET
The connection reset event is fired on completion of PQreset or PQresetPoll. In both cases,
the event is only fired if the reset was successful. The return value of the event procedure is
ignored in PostgreSQL v15 and later. With earlier versions, however, it's important to return
```
success (nonzero) or the connection will be aborted.
```
1033
libpq — C Library
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
PGconn *conn;
```
```
} PGEventConnReset;
```
When a PGEVT_CONNRESET event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to a
PGEventConnReset *. Although the contained PGconn was just reset, all event data remains
unchanged. This event should be used to reset/reload/requery any associated instanceData.
Note that even if the event procedure fails to process PGEVT_CONNRESET, it will still receive
a PGEVT_CONNDESTROY event when the connection is closed.
PGEVT_CONNDESTROY
The connection destroy event is fired in response to PQfinish. It is the event procedure's re-
sponsibility to properly clean up its event data as libpq has no ability to manage this memory.
Failure to clean up will lead to memory leaks.
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
PGconn *conn;
```
```
} PGEventConnDestroy;
```
When a PGEVT_CONNDESTROY event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to a
PGEventConnDestroy *. This event is fired prior to PQfinish performing any other
cleanup. The return value of the event procedure is ignored since there is no way of indicating a
failure from PQfinish. Also, an event procedure failure should not abort the process of cleaning
up unwanted memory.
PGEVT_RESULTCREATE
The result creation event is fired in response to any query execution function that generates a
result, including PQgetResult. This event will only be fired after the result has been created
successfully.
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
PGconn *conn;
```
```
PGresult *result;
```
```
} PGEventResultCreate;
```
When a PGEVT_RESULTCREATE event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to a
PGEventResultCreate *. The conn is the connection used to generate the result. This is
the ideal place to initialize any instanceData that needs to be associated with the result. If an
```
event procedure fails (returns zero), that event procedure will be ignored for the remaining lifetime
```
```
of the result; that is, it will not receive PGEVT_RESULTCOPY or PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY
```
events for this result or results copied from it.
PGEVT_RESULTCOPY
The result copy event is fired in response to PQcopyResult. This event will only be
fired after the copy is complete. Only event procedures that have successfully handled the
PGEVT_RESULTCREATE or PGEVT_RESULTCOPY event for the source result will receive
PGEVT_RESULTCOPY events.
typedef struct
```
{
```
1034
libpq — C Library
```
const PGresult *src;
```
```
PGresult *dest;
```
```
} PGEventResultCopy;
```
When a PGEVT_RESULTCOPY event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to a
PGEventResultCopy *. The src result is what was copied while the dest result is the copy
destination. This event can be used to provide a deep copy of instanceData, since PQcopy-
```
Result cannot do that. If an event procedure fails (returns zero), that event procedure will be
```
```
ignored for the remaining lifetime of the new result; that is, it will not receive PGEVT_RESULT-
```
COPY or PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY events for that result or results copied from it.
PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY
The result destroy event is fired in response to a PQclear. It is the event procedure's responsi-
bility to properly clean up its event data as libpq has no ability to manage this memory. Failure
to clean up will lead to memory leaks.
typedef struct
```
{
```
```
PGresult *result;
```
```
} PGEventResultDestroy;
```
When a PGEVT_RESULTDESTROY event is received, the evtInfo pointer should be cast to
a PGEventResultDestroy *. This event is fired prior to PQclear performing any other
cleanup. The return value of the event procedure is ignored since there is no way of indicating a
failure from PQclear. Also, an event procedure failure should not abort the process of cleaning
up unwanted memory.
32.14.2. Event Callback Procedure
PGEventProc
PGEventProc is a typedef for a pointer to an event procedure, that is, the user callback function
that receives events from libpq. The signature of an event procedure must be
```
int eventproc(PGEventId evtId, void *evtInfo, void *passThrough)
```
The evtId parameter indicates which PGEVT event occurred. The evtInfo pointer must
be cast to the appropriate structure type to obtain further information about the event. The
passThrough parameter is the pointer provided to PQregisterEventProc when the event
procedure was registered. The function should return a non-zero value if it succeeds and zero if
it fails.
A particular event procedure can be registered only once in any PGconn. This is because the
address of the procedure is used as a lookup key to identify the associated instance data.
Caution
On Windows, functions can have two different addresses: one visible from outside a DLL
and another visible from inside the DLL. One should be careful that only one of these
addresses is used with libpq's event-procedure functions, else confusion will result. The
simplest rule for writing code that will work is to ensure that event procedures are declared
static. If the procedure's address must be available outside its own source file, expose
a separate function to return the address.
1035
libpq — C Library
32.14.3. Event Support Functions
PQregisterEventProc
Registers an event callback procedure with libpq.
```
int PQregisterEventProc(PGconn *conn, PGEventProc proc,
```
```
const char *name, void *passThrough);
```
An event procedure must be registered once on each PGconn you want to receive events about.
There is no limit, other than memory, on the number of event procedures that can be registered
with a connection. The function returns a non-zero value if it succeeds and zero if it fails.
The proc argument will be called when a libpq event is fired. Its memory address is also used
to lookup instanceData. The name argument is used to refer to the event procedure in error
messages. This value cannot be NULL or a zero-length string. The name string is copied into the
PGconn, so what is passed need not be long-lived. The passThrough pointer is passed to the
proc whenever an event occurs. This argument can be NULL.
PQsetInstanceData
Sets the connection conn's instanceData for procedure proc to data. This returns non-
```
zero for success and zero for failure. (Failure is only possible if proc has not been properly
```
```
registered in conn.)
```
```
int PQsetInstanceData(PGconn *conn, PGEventProc proc, void
```
```
*data);
```
PQinstanceData
Returns the connection conn's instanceData associated with procedure proc, or NULL if
there is none.
```
void *PQinstanceData(const PGconn *conn, PGEventProc proc);
```
PQresultSetInstanceData
Sets the result's instanceData for proc to data. This returns non-zero for success and zero
```
for failure. (Failure is only possible if proc has not been properly registered in the result.)
```
```
int PQresultSetInstanceData(PGresult *res, PGEventProc proc,
```
```
void *data);
```
Beware that any storage represented by data will not be accounted for by PQresultMemo-
```
rySize, unless it is allocated using PQresultAlloc. (Doing so is recommendable because
```
```
it eliminates the need to free such storage explicitly when the result is destroyed.)
```
PQresultInstanceData
Returns the result's instanceData associated with proc, or NULL if there is none.
```
void *PQresultInstanceData(const PGresult *res, PGEventProc
```
```
proc);
```

32.15. Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be used to select default connection parameter values, which
will be used by PQconnectdb, PQsetdbLogin and PQsetdb if no value is directly specified by
the calling code. These are useful to avoid hard-coding database connection information into simple
client applications, for example.
• PGHOST behaves the same as the host connection parameter.
1039
libpq — C Library
• PGSSLNEGOTIATION behaves the same as the sslnegotiation connection parameter.
• PGHOSTADDR behaves the same as the hostaddr connection parameter. This can be set instead of
or in addition to PGHOST to avoid DNS lookup overhead.
• PGPORT behaves the same as the port connection parameter.
• PGDATABASE behaves the same as the dbname connection parameter.
• PGUSER behaves the same as the user connection parameter.
• PGPASSWORD behaves the same as the password connection parameter. Use of this environment
variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to
```
see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using a password file (see Section 32.16).
```
• PGPASSFILE behaves the same as the passfile connection parameter.
• PGREQUIREAUTH behaves the same as the require_auth connection parameter.
• PGCHANNELBINDING behaves the same as the channel_binding connection parameter.

```
The following environment variables determine internal behavior of libpq; they override compiled-in
```
defaults.
• PGSYSCONFDIR sets the directory containing the pg_service.conf file and in a future ver-
sion possibly other system-wide configuration files.
• PGLOCALEDIR sets the directory containing the locale files for message localization.
32.16. The Password File
The file .pgpass in a user's home directory can contain passwords to be used if the connection re-
```
quires a password (and no password has been specified otherwise). On Unix systems, the directory
```
can be specified by the HOME environment variable, or if undefined, the home directory of the effec-
tive user. On Microsoft Windows the file is named %APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf
```
(where %APPDATA% refers to the Application Data subdirectory in the user's profile). Alternatively,
```
the password file to use can be specified using the connection parameter passfile or the environment
variable PGPASSFILE.
This file should contain lines of the following format:
```
hostname:port:database:username:password
```
```
(You can add a reminder comment to the file by copying the line above and preceding it with #.) Each
```
of the first four fields can be a literal value, or *, which matches anything. The password field from the
```
first line that matches the current connection parameters will be used. (Therefore, put more-specific
```
1041
libpq — C Library
```
entries first when you are using wildcards.) If an entry needs to contain : or \, escape this character
```
with \. The host name field is matched to the host connection parameter if that is specified, otherwise
```
to the hostaddr parameter if that is specified; if neither are given then the host name localhost is
```
searched for. The host name localhost is also searched for when the connection is a Unix-domain
socket connection and the host parameter matches libpq's default socket directory path. In a standby
server, a database field of replication matches streaming replication connections made to the
primary server. The database field is of limited usefulness otherwise, because users have the same
password for all databases in the same cluster.
```
On Unix systems, the permissions on a password file must disallow any access to world or group;
```
achieve this by a command such as chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass. If the permissions are less strict
than this, the file will be ignored. On Microsoft Windows, it is assumed that the file is stored in a
directory that is secure, so no special permissions check is made.
32.17. The Connection Service File
The connection service file allows libpq connection parameters to be associated with a single service
name. That service name can then be specified using the service key word in a libpq connection
string, and the associated settings will be used. This allows connection parameters to be modified
without requiring a recompile of the libpq-using application. The service name can also be specified
using the PGSERVICE environment variable.
Service names can be defined in either a per-user service file or a system-wide file. If the same service
name exists in both the user and the system file, the user file takes precedence. By default, the per-user
service file is named ~/.pg_service.conf. On Microsoft Windows, it is named %APPDATA%
```
\postgresql\.pg_service.conf (where %APPDATA% refers to the Application Data subdi-
```
```
rectory in the user's profile). A different file name can be specified by setting the environment variable
```
PGSERVICEFILE. The system-wide file is named pg_service.conf. By default it is sought in
```
the etc directory of the PostgreSQL installation (use pg_config --sysconfdir to identify this
```
```
directory precisely). Another directory, but not a different file name, can be specified by setting the
```
environment variable PGSYSCONFDIR.
Either service file uses an “INI file” format where the section name is the service name and the para-
```
meters are connection parameters; see Section 32.1.2 for a list. For example:
```
# comment
[mydb]
```
host=somehost
```
```
port=5433
```
```
user=admin
```
An example file is provided in the PostgreSQL installation at share/pg_service.conf.sam-
ple.
Connection parameters obtained from a service file are combined with parameters obtained from other
sources. A service file setting overrides the corresponding environment variable, and in turn can be
overridden by a value given directly in the connection string. For example, using the above service
file, a connection string service=mydb port=5434 will use host somehost, port 5434, user
admin, and other parameters as set by environment variables or built-in defaults.
32.18. LDAP Lookup of Connection Parame-
ters
```
If libpq has been compiled with LDAP support (option --with-ldap for configure) it is possible
```
to retrieve connection options like host or dbname via LDAP from a central server. The advantage
1042
libpq — C Library
is that if the connection parameters for a database change, the connection information doesn't have to
be updated on all client machines.
```
LDAP connection parameter lookup uses the connection service file pg_service.conf (see Sec-
```
```
tion 32.17). A line in a pg_service.conf stanza that starts with ldap:// will be recognized
```
as an LDAP URL and an LDAP query will be performed. The result must be a list of keyword =
value pairs which will be used to set connection options. The URL must conform to RFC 19595
and be of the form
```
ldap://[hostname[:port]]/search_base?attribute?search_scope?filter
```
where hostname defaults to localhost and port defaults to 389.
Processing of pg_service.conf is terminated after a successful LDAP lookup, but is continued
if the LDAP server cannot be contacted. This is to provide a fallback with further LDAP URL lines
that point to different LDAP servers, classical keyword = value pairs, or default connection
options. If you would rather get an error message in this case, add a syntactically incorrect line after
the LDAP URL.
A sample LDAP entry that has been created with the LDIF file
```
version:1
```
```
dn:cn=mydatabase,dc=mycompany,dc=com
```
```
changetype:add
```
```
objectclass:top
```
```
objectclass:device
```
```
cn:mydatabase
```
```
description:host=dbserver.mycompany.com
```
```
description:port=5439
```
```
description:dbname=mydb
```
```
description:user=mydb_user
```
```
description:sslmode=require
```
might be queried with the following LDAP URL:
```
ldap://ldap.mycompany.com/dc=mycompany,dc=com?description?one?
```
```
(cn=mydatabase)
```
You can also mix regular service file entries with LDAP lookups. A complete example for a stanza
in pg_service.conf would be:
# only host and port are stored in LDAP, specify dbname and user
explicitly
[customerdb]
```
dbname=customer
```
```
user=appuser
```
```
ldap://ldap.acme.com/cn=dbserver,cn=hosts?pgconnectinfo?base?
```
```
(objectclass=*)
```
32.19. SSL Support
PostgreSQL has native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications
using TLS protocols for increased security. See Section 18.9 for details about the server-side SSL
functionality.
5 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1959
1043
libpq — C Library
libpq reads the system-wide OpenSSL configuration file. By default, this file is named openssl.c-
nf and is located in the directory reported by openssl version -d. This default can be overrid-
den by setting environment variable OPENSSL_CONF to the name of the desired configuration file.
32.19.1. Client Verification of Server Certificates
By default, PostgreSQL will not perform any verification of the server certificate. This means that it
```
is possible to spoof the server identity (for example by modifying a DNS record or by taking over the
```
```
server IP address) without the client knowing. In order to prevent spoofing, the client must be able to
```
```
verify the server's identity via a chain of trust. A chain of trust is established by placing a root (self-
```
```
signed) certificate authority (CA) certificate on one computer and a leaf certificate signed by the root
```
certificate on another computer. It is also possible to use an “intermediate” certificate which is signed
by the root certificate and signs leaf certificates.
To allow the client to verify the identity of the server, place a root certificate on the client and a leaf
certificate signed by the root certificate on the server. To allow the server to verify the identity of the
client, place a root certificate on the server and a leaf certificate signed by the root certificate on the
```
client. One or more intermediate certificates (usually stored with the leaf certificate) can also be used
```
to link the leaf certificate to the root certificate.
Once a chain of trust has been established, there are two ways for the client to validate the leaf cer-
tificate sent by the server. If the parameter sslmode is set to verify-ca, libpq will verify that the
server is trustworthy by checking the certificate chain up to the root certificate stored on the client.
If sslmode is set to verify-full, libpq will also verify that the server host name matches the
name stored in the server certificate. The SSL connection will fail if the server certificate cannot be
verified. verify-full is recommended in most security-sensitive environments.
In verify-full mode, the host name is matched against the certificate's Subject Alternative Name
```
attribute(s) (SAN), or against the Common Name attribute if no SAN of type dNSName is present.
```
```
If the certificate's name attribute starts with an asterisk (*), the asterisk will be treated as a wildcard,
```
```
which will match all characters except a dot (.). This means the certificate will not match subdomains.
```
If the connection is made using an IP address instead of a host name, the IP address will be matched
```
(without doing any DNS lookups) against SANs of type iPAddress or dNSName. If no iPAd-
```
dress SAN is present and no matching dNSName SAN is present, the host IP address is matched
against the Common Name attribute.
Note
For backward compatibility with earlier versions of PostgreSQL, the host IP address is veri-
fied in a manner different from RFC 61256. The host IP address is always matched against
dNSName SANs as well as iPAddress SANs, and can be matched against the Common
Name attribute if no relevant SANs exist.
To allow server certificate verification, one or more root certificates must be placed in the file
```
~/.postgresql/root.crt in the user's home directory. (On Microsoft Windows the file is
```
```
named %APPDATA%\postgresql\root.crt.) Intermediate certificates should also be added to
```
the file if they are needed to link the certificate chain sent by the server to the root certificates stored
on the client.
```
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) entries are also checked if the file ~/.postgresql/root.crl
```
```
exists (%APPDATA%\postgresql\root.crl on Microsoft Windows).
```
The location of the root certificate file and the CRL can be changed by setting the connection parame-
ters sslrootcert and sslcrl or the environment variables PGSSLROOTCERT and PGSSLCRL.
6 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6125
1044
libpq — C Library
sslcrldir or the environment variable PGSSLCRLDIR can also be used to specify a directory
containing CRL files.
Note
For backwards compatibility with earlier versions of PostgreSQL, if a root CA file exists, the
behavior of sslmode=require will be the same as that of verify-ca, meaning the serv-
er certificate is validated against the CA. Relying on this behavior is discouraged, and appli-
cations that need certificate validation should always use verify-ca or verify-full.
32.19.2. Client Certificates
If the server attempts to verify the identity of the client by requesting the client's leaf certificate, libpq
```
will send the certificate(s) stored in file ~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt in the user's home
```
directory. The certificates must chain to the root certificate trusted by the server. A matching pri-
vate key file ~/.postgresql/postgresql.key must also be present. On Microsoft Windows
these files are named %APPDATA%\postgresql\postgresql.crt and %APPDATA%\post-
gresql\postgresql.key. The location of the certificate and key files can be overridden by the
connection parameters sslcert and sslkey, or by the environment variables PGSSLCERT and
PGSSLKEY.
```
On Unix systems, the permissions on the private key file must disallow any access to world or group;
```
achieve this by a command such as chmod 0600 ~/.postgresql/postgresql.key. Al-
```
ternatively, the file can be owned by root and have group read access (that is, 0640 permissions).
```
That setup is intended for installations where certificate and key files are managed by the operating
system. The user of libpq should then be made a member of the group that has access to those certifi-
```
cate and key files. (On Microsoft Windows, there is no file permissions check, since the %APPDATA%
```
```
\postgresql directory is presumed secure.)
```
The first certificate in postgresql.crt must be the client's certificate because it must match the
client's private key. “Intermediate” certificates can be optionally appended to the file — doing so
```
avoids requiring storage of intermediate certificates on the server (ssl_ca_file).
```
The certificate and key may be in PEM or ASN.1 DER format.
The key may be stored in cleartext or encrypted with a passphrase using any algorithm supported
by OpenSSL, like AES-128. If the key is stored encrypted, then the passphrase may be provided in
the sslpassword connection option. If an encrypted key is supplied and the sslpassword option
is absent or blank, a password will be prompted for interactively by OpenSSL with a Enter PEM
pass phrase: prompt if a TTY is available. Applications can override the client certificate prompt
```
and the handling of the sslpassword parameter by supplying their own key password callback; see
```
PQsetSSLKeyPassHook_OpenSSL.
For instructions on creating certificates, see Section 18.9.5.
32.19.3. Protection Provided in Different Modes
The different values for the sslmode parameter provide different levels of protection. SSL can pro-
vide protection against three types of attacks:
Eavesdropping
If a third party can examine the network traffic between the client and the server, it can read both
```
connection information (including the user name and password) and the data that is passed. SSL
```
uses encryption to prevent this.
1045
libpq — C Library
```
Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
```
If a third party can modify the data while passing between the client and server, it can pretend to
be the server and therefore see and modify data even if it is encrypted. The third party can then
forward the connection information and data to the original server, making it impossible to detect
this attack. Common vectors to do this include DNS poisoning and address hijacking, whereby the
client is directed to a different server than intended. There are also several other attack methods
that can accomplish this. SSL uses certificate verification to prevent this, by authenticating the
server to the client.
Impersonation
If a third party can pretend to be an authorized client, it can simply access data it should not have
access to. Typically this can happen through insecure password management. SSL uses client
certificates to prevent this, by making sure that only holders of valid certificates can access the
server.
For a connection to be known SSL-secured, SSL usage must be configured on both the client and
the server before the connection is made. If it is only configured on the server, the client may end up
```
sending sensitive information (e.g., passwords) before it knows that the server requires high security.
```
In libpq, secure connections can be ensured by setting the sslmode parameter to verify-full or
verify-ca, and providing the system with a root certificate to verify against. This is analogous to
using an https URL for encrypted web browsing.
Once the server has been authenticated, the client can pass sensitive data. This means that up until this
point, the client does not need to know if certificates will be used for authentication, making it safe
to specify that only in the server configuration.
All SSL options carry overhead in the form of encryption and key-exchange, so there is a trade-off
that has to be made between performance and security. Table 32.1 illustrates the risks the different
sslmode values protect against, and what statement they make about security and overhead.
Table 32.1. SSL Mode Descriptions
sslmode Eavesdropping
protection
MITM protection Statement
disable No No I don't care about security, and I don't
want to pay the overhead of encryp-
tion.
allow Maybe No I don't care about security, but I will
pay the overhead of encryption if the
server insists on it.
prefer Maybe No I don't care about encryption, but I
wish to pay the overhead of encryption
if the server supports it.
require Yes No I want my data to be encrypted, and
I accept the overhead. I trust that the
network will make sure I always con-
nect to the server I want.
verify-ca Yes Depends on CA
policy
I want my data encrypted, and I accept
the overhead. I want to be sure that I
connect to a server that I trust.
verify-full Yes Yes I want my data encrypted, and I accept
the overhead. I want to be sure that I
connect to a server I trust, and that it's
the one I specify.
1046
libpq — C Library
The difference between verify-ca and verify-full depends on the policy of the root CA. If a
public CA is used, verify-ca allows connections to a server that somebody else may have registered
with the CA. In this case, verify-full should always be used. If a local CA is used, or even a self-
signed certificate, using verify-ca often provides enough protection.
The default value for sslmode is prefer. As is shown in the table, this makes no sense from a
security point of view, and it only promises performance overhead if possible. It is only provided as
the default for backward compatibility, and is not recommended in secure deployments.
32.19.4. SSL Client File Usage

32.19.5. SSL Library Initialization
Applications which need to be compatible with older versions of PostgreSQL, using OpenSSL version
1.0.2 or older, need to initialize the SSL library before using it. Applications which initialize libssl
and/or libcrypto libraries should call PQinitOpenSSL to tell libpq that the libssl and/or
libcrypto libraries have been initialized by your application, so that libpq will not also initialize
those libraries. However, this is unnecessary when using OpenSSL version 1.1.0 or later, as duplicate
initializations are no longer problematic.
Refer to the documentation for the version of PostgreSQL that you are targeting for details on their use.
PQinitOpenSSL
Allows applications to select which security libraries to initialize.
```
void PQinitOpenSSL(int do_ssl, int do_crypto);
```
This function is deprecated and only present for backwards compatibility, it does nothing.
PQinitSSL
Allows applications to select which security libraries to initialize.
```
void PQinitSSL(int do_ssl);
```
```
This function is equivalent to PQinitOpenSSL(do_ssl, do_ssl). This function is dep-
```
recated and only present for backwards compatibility, it does nothing.
PQinitSSL and PQinitOpenSSL are maintained for backwards compatibility, but are no
longer required since PostgreSQL 18. PQinitSSL has been present since PostgreSQL 8.0, while
1047
libpq — C Library
PQinitOpenSSL was added in PostgreSQL 8.4, so PQinitSSL might be preferable for ap-
plications that need to work with older versions of libpq.
32.20. OAuth Support
libpq implements support for the OAuth v2 Device Authorization client flow, documented in RFC
86287, as an optional module. See the installation documentation for information on how to enable
support for Device Authorization as a builtin flow.
When support is enabled and the optional module installed, libpq will use the builtin flow by default
if the server requests a bearer token during authentication. This flow can be utilized even if the system
running the client application does not have a usable web browser, for example when running a client
via SSH.
The builtin flow will, by default, print a URL to visit and a user code to enter there:
$ psql 'dbname=postgres oauth_issuer=https://example.com
```
oauth_client_id=...'
```
Visit https://example.com/device and enter the code: ABCD-EFGH
```
(This prompt may be customized.) The user will then log into their OAuth provider, which will ask
```
whether to allow libpq and the server to perform actions on their behalf. It is always a good idea
to carefully review the URL and permissions displayed, to ensure they match expectations, before
continuing. Permissions should not be given to untrusted third parties.
Client applications may implement their own flows to customize interaction and integration with ap-
plications. See Section 32.20.1 for more information on how add a custom flow to libpq.
For an OAuth client flow to be usable, the connection string must at minimum contain oauth_issuer and
```
oauth_client_id. (These settings are determined by your organization's OAuth provider.) The builtin
```
flow additionally requires the OAuth authorization server to publish a device authorization endpoint.
Note
The builtin Device Authorization flow is not currently supported on Windows. Custom client
flows may still be implemented.
32.20.1. Authdata Hooks
The behavior of the OAuth flow may be modified or replaced by a client using the following hook API:
PQsetAuthDataHook
Sets the PGauthDataHook, overriding libpq's handling of one or more aspects of its OAuth
client flow.
```
void PQsetAuthDataHook(PQauthDataHook_type hook);
```
If hook is NULL, the default handler will be reinstalled. Otherwise, the application passes a
pointer to a callback function with the signature:
```
int hook_fn(PGauthData type, PGconn *conn, void *data);
```
7 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628
1048
libpq — C Library
which libpq will call when an action is required of the application. type describes the request
being made, conn is the connection handle being authenticated, and data points to request-spe-
```
cific metadata. The contents of this pointer are determined by type; see Section 32.20.1.1 for
```
the supported list.
Hooks can be chained together to allow cooperative and/or fallback behavior. In general, a hook
```
implementation should examine the incoming type (and, potentially, the request metadata and/
```
```
or the settings for the particular conn in use) to decide whether or not to handle a specific piece
```
```
of authdata. If not, it should delegate to the previous hook in the chain (retrievable via PQge-
```
```
tAuthDataHook).
```
Success is indicated by returning an integer greater than zero. Returning a negative integer signals
```
an error condition and abandons the connection attempt. (A zero value is reserved for the default
```
```
implementation.)
```
PQgetAuthDataHook
Retrieves the current value of PGauthDataHook.
```
PQauthDataHook_type PQgetAuthDataHook(void);
```
```
At initialization time (before the first call to PQsetAuthDataHook), this function will return
```
PQdefaultAuthDataHook.
32.20.1.1. Hook Types
The following PGauthData types and their corresponding data structures are defined:
PQAUTHDATA_PROMPT_OAUTH_DEVICE
Replaces the default user prompt during the builtin device authorization client flow. data points
to an instance of PGpromptOAuthDevice:
typedef struct _PGpromptOAuthDevice
```
{
```
```
const char *verification_uri; /* verification URI to visit
```
*/
```
const char *user_code; /* user code to enter */
```
```
const char *verification_uri_complete; /* optional
```
combination of URI and
- code, or NULL */
```
int expires_in; /* seconds until user code
```
expires */
```
} PGpromptOAuthDevice;
```
The OAuth Device Authorization flow which can be included in libpq requires the end user to
visit a URL with a browser, then enter a code which permits libpq to connect to the server on
their behalf. The default prompt simply prints the verification_uri and user_code on
standard error. Replacement implementations may display this information using any preferred
method, for example with a GUI.
This callback is only invoked during the builtin device authorization flow. If the application in-
stalls a custom OAuth flow, or libpq was not built with support for the builtin flow, this authdata
type will not be used.
If a non-NULL verification_uri_complete is provided, it may optionally be used for
```
non-textual verification (for example, by displaying a QR code). The URL and user code should
```
still be displayed to the end user in this case, because the code will be manually confirmed by the
1049
libpq — C Library
provider, and the URL lets users continue even if they can't use the non-textual method. For more
information, see section 3.3.1 in RFC 86288.
PQAUTHDATA_OAUTH_BEARER_TOKEN
Adds a custom implementation of a flow, replacing the builtin flow if it is installed. The hook
should either directly return a Bearer token for the current user/issuer/scope combination, if one
is available without blocking, or else set up an asynchronous callback to retrieve one.
data points to an instance of PGoauthBearerRequest, which should be filled in by the
```
implementation:
```
typedef struct PGoauthBearerRequest
```
{
```
```
/* Hook inputs (constant across all calls) */
```
```
const char *openid_configuration; /* OIDC discovery URL */
```
```
const char *scope; /* required scope(s), or
```
NULL */
/* Hook outputs */
/* Callback implementing a custom asynchronous OAuth flow.
*/
```
PostgresPollingStatusType (*async) (PGconn *conn,
```
struct
PGoauthBearerRequest *request,
```
SOCKTYPE *altsock);
```
/* Callback to clean up custom allocations. */
```
void (*cleanup) (PGconn *conn, struct
```
```
PGoauthBearerRequest *request);
```
```
char *token; /* acquired Bearer token */
```
```
void *user; /* hook-defined allocated data */
```
```
} PGoauthBearerRequest;
```
Two pieces of information are provided to the hook by libpq: openid_configuration con-
tains the URL of an OAuth discovery document describing the authorization server's supported
```
flows, and scope contains a (possibly empty) space-separated list of OAuth scopes which are
```
required to access the server. Either or both may be NULL to indicate that the information was
```
not discoverable. (In this case, implementations may be able to establish the requirements using
```
```
some other preconfigured knowledge, or they may choose to fail.)
```
The final output of the hook is token, which must point to a valid Bearer token for use on the
```
connection. (This token should be issued by the oauth_issuer and hold the requested scopes, or
```
```
the connection will be rejected by the server's validator module.) The allocated token string must
```
```
remain valid until libpq is finished connecting; the hook should set a cleanup callback which
```
will be called when libpq no longer requires it.
If an implementation cannot immediately produce a token during the initial call to the hook,
it should set the async callback to handle nonblocking communication with the authorization
server. 9 This will be called to begin the flow immediately upon return from the hook. When the
callback cannot make further progress without blocking, it should return either PGRES_POL-
LING_READING or PGRES_POLLING_WRITING after setting *pgsocket to the file de-
8 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628#section-3.3.1
9 Performing blocking operations during the PQAUTHDATA_OAUTH_BEARER_TOKEN hook callback will interfere with nonblocking con-
nection APIs such as PQconnectPoll and prevent concurrent connections from making progress. Applications which only ever use the
synchronous connection primitives, such as PQconnectdb, may synchronously retrieve a token during the hook instead of implementing
the async callback, but they will necessarily be limited to one connection at a time.

```
scriptor that will be marked ready to read/write when progress can be made again. (This descriptor
```
```
is then provided to the top-level polling loop via PQsocket().) Return PGRES_POLLING_OK
```
after setting token when the flow is complete, or PGRES_POLLING_FAILED to indicate fail-
ure.
Implementations may wish to store additional data for bookkeeping across calls to the async
```
and cleanup callbacks. The user pointer is provided for this purpose; libpq will not touch its
```
```
contents and the application may use it at its convenience. (Remember to free any allocations
```
```
during token cleanup.)
```
32.20.2. Debugging and Developer Settings
A "dangerous debugging mode" may be enabled by setting the environment variable PGOAUTHDE-
```
BUG=UNSAFE. This functionality is provided for ease of local development and testing only. It does
```
several things that you will not want a production system to do:
• permits the use of unencrypted HTTP during the OAuth provider exchange
• allows the system's trusted CA list to be completely replaced using the PGOAUTHCAFILE envi-
ronment variable
```
• prints HTTP traffic (containing several critical secrets) to standard error during the OAuth flow
```
• permits the use of zero-second retry intervals, which can cause the client to busy-loop and point-
lessly consume CPU
Warning
Do not share the output of the OAuth flow traffic with third parties. It contains secrets that can
be used to attack your clients and servers.
32.21. Behavior in Threaded Programs
As of version 17, libpq is always reentrant and thread-safe. However, one restriction is that no two
threads attempt to manipulate the same PGconn object at the same time. In particular, you cannot
```
issue concurrent commands from different threads through the same connection object. (If you need
```
```
to run concurrent commands, use multiple connections.)
```
PGresult objects are normally read-only after creation, and so can be passed around freely between
threads. However, if you use any of the PGresult-modifying functions described in Section 32.12
or Section 32.14, it's up to you to avoid concurrent operations on the same PGresult, too.
In earlier versions, libpq could be compiled with or without thread support, depending on compiler
options. This function allows the querying of libpq's thread-safe status:
PQisthreadsafe
Returns the thread safety status of the libpq library.
```
int PQisthreadsafe();
```
Returns 1 if the libpq is thread-safe and 0 if it is not. Always returns 1 on version 17 and above.
The deprecated functions PQrequestCancel and PQoidStatus are not thread-safe and should
not be used in multithread programs. PQrequestCancel can be replaced by PQcancelBlock-
ing. PQoidStatus can be replaced by PQoidValue.
```
If you are using Kerberos inside your application (in addition to inside libpq), you will need to do
```
locking around Kerberos calls because Kerberos functions are not thread-safe. See function PQreg-
isterThreadLock in the libpq source code for a way to do cooperative locking between libpq
and your application.
1051
libpq — C Library
Similarly, if you are using Curl inside your application, and you do not already initialize libcurl
```
globally10 before starting new threads, you will need to cooperatively lock (again via PQregis-
```
```
terThreadLock) around any code that may initialize libcurl. This restriction is lifted for more re-
```
```
cent versions of Curl that are built to support thread-safe initialization; those builds can be identified
```
by the advertisement of a threadsafe feature in their version metadata.
32.22. Building libpq Programs
```
To build (i.e., compile and link) a program using libpq you need to do all of the following things:
```
• Include the libpq-fe.h header file:
#include <libpq-fe.h>
If you failed to do that then you will normally get error messages from your compiler similar to:
foo.c: In function `main':
```
foo.c:34: `PGconn' undeclared (first use in this function)
```
```
foo.c:35: `PGresult' undeclared (first use in this function)
```
```
foo.c:54: `CONNECTION_BAD' undeclared (first use in this
```
```
function)
```
```
foo.c:68: `PGRES_COMMAND_OK' undeclared (first use in this
```
```
function)
```
```
foo.c:95: `PGRES_TUPLES_OK' undeclared (first use in this
```
```
function)
```
• Point your compiler to the directory where the PostgreSQL header files were installed, by supplying
```
the -Idirectory option to your compiler. (In some cases the compiler will look into the directory
```
```
in question by default, so you can omit this option.) For instance, your compile command line could
```
look like:
cc -c -I/usr/local/pgsql/include testprog.c
If you are using makefiles then add the option to the CPPFLAGS variable:
CPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/pgsql/include
If there is any chance that your program might be compiled by other users then you should not
hardcode the directory location like that. Instead, you can run the utility pg_config to find out
where the header files are on the local system:
$ pg_config --includedir
/usr/local/include
If you have pkg-config installed, you can run instead:
$ pkg-config --cflags libpq
-I/usr/local/include
Note that this will already include the -I in front of the path.
Failure to specify the correct option to the compiler will result in an error message such as:
10 https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_global_init.html
1052
libpq — C Library
testlibpq.c:8:22: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory
• When linking the final program, specify the option -lpq so that the libpq library gets pulled in,
as well as the option -Ldirectory to point the compiler to the directory where the libpq library
```
resides. (Again, the compiler will search some directories by default.) For maximum portability,
```
put the -L option before the -lpq option. For example:
cc -o testprog testprog1.o testprog2.o -L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -
lpq
You can find out the library directory using pg_config as well:
$ pg_config --libdir
/usr/local/pgsql/lib
Or again use pkg-config:
$ pkg-config --libs libpq
-L/usr/local/pgsql/lib -lpq
Note again that this prints the full options, not only the path.
Error messages that point to problems in this area could look like the following:
testlibpq.o: In function `main':
```
testlibpq.o(.text+0x60): undefined reference to `PQsetdbLogin'
```
```
testlibpq.o(.text+0x71): undefined reference to `PQstatus'
```
```
testlibpq.o(.text+0xa4): undefined reference to `PQerrorMessage'
```
This means you forgot -lpq.
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpq
This means you forgot the -L option or did not specify the right directory.
