Chapter 23. Localization
This chapter describes the available localization features from the point of view of the administrator.
PostgreSQL supports two localization facilities:
• Using the locale features of the operating system to provide locale-specific collation order, number
formatting, translated messages, and other aspects. This is covered in Section 23.1 and Section 23.2.
• Providing a number of different character sets to support storing text in all kinds of languages, and
providing character set translation between client and server. This is covered in Section 23.3.
23.1. Locale Support
Locale support refers to an application respecting cultural preferences regarding alphabets, sorting,
number formatting, etc. PostgreSQL uses the standard ISO C and POSIX locale facilities provided by
the server operating system. For additional information refer to the documentation of your system.
23.1.1. Overview
Locale support is automatically initialized when a database cluster is created using initdb. initdb
will initialize the database cluster with the locale setting of its execution environment by default, so if
your system is already set to use the locale that you want in your database cluster then there is nothing
```
else you need to do. If you want to use a different locale (or you are not sure which locale your system
```
```
is set to), you can instruct initdb exactly which locale to use by specifying the --locale option.
```
For example:
initdb --locale=sv_SE
```
This example for Unix systems sets the locale to Swedish (sv) as spoken in Sweden (SE). Other
```
```
possibilities might include en_US (U.S. English) and fr_CA (French Canadian). If more than one
```
character set can be used for a locale then the specifications can take the form language_terri-
```
tory.codeset. For example, fr_BE.UTF-8 represents the French language (fr) as spoken in
```
```
Belgium (BE), with a UTF-8 character set encoding.
```
What locales are available on your system under what names depends on what was provided by the
operating system vendor and what was installed. On most Unix systems, the command locale -
a will provide a list of available locales. Windows uses more verbose locale names, such as Ger-
man_Germany or Swedish_Sweden.1252, but the principles are the same.
Occasionally it is useful to mix rules from several locales, e.g., use English collation rules but Spanish
messages. To support that, a set of locale subcategories exist that control only certain aspects of the
localization rules:
LC_COLLATE String sort order
```
LC_CTYPE Character classification (What is a letter? Its upper-case equivalent?)
```
LC_MESSAGES Language of messages
LC_MONETARY Formatting of currency amounts
LC_NUMERIC Formatting of numbers
LC_TIME Formatting of dates and times
The category names translate into names of initdb options to override the locale choice for a specific
category. For instance, to set the locale to French Canadian, but use U.S. rules for formatting currency,
use initdb --locale=fr_CA --lc-monetary=en_US.
If you want the system to behave as if it had no locale support, use the special locale name C, or
equivalently POSIX.
760
Localization
Some locale categories must have their values fixed when the database is created. You can use differ-
ent settings for different databases, but once a database is created, you cannot change them for that
database anymore. LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE are these categories. They affect the sort order of
```
indexes, so they must be kept fixed, or indexes on text columns would become corrupt. (But you can
```
```
alleviate this restriction using collations, as discussed in Section 23.2.) The default values for these
```
categories are determined when initdb is run, and those values are used when new databases are
created, unless specified otherwise in the CREATE DATABASE command.
The other locale categories can be changed whenever desired by setting the server configuration
```
parameters that have the same name as the locale categories (see Section 19.11.2 for details). The
```
values that are chosen by initdb are actually only written into the configuration file post-
gresql.conf to serve as defaults when the server is started. If you remove these assignments from
postgresql.conf then the server will inherit the settings from its execution environment.
Note that the locale behavior of the server is determined by the environment variables seen by the
server, not by the environment of any client. Therefore, be careful to configure the correct locale
settings before starting the server. A consequence of this is that if client and server are set up in different
locales, messages might appear in different languages depending on where they originated.
Note
When we speak of inheriting the locale from the execution environment, this means the fol-
lowing on most operating systems: For a given locale category, say the collation, the follow-
ing environment variables are consulted in this order until one is found to be set: LC_ALL,
```
LC_COLLATE (or the variable corresponding to the respective category), LANG. If none of
```
these environment variables are set then the locale defaults to C.
Some message localization libraries also look at the environment variable LANGUAGE which
overrides all other locale settings for the purpose of setting the language of messages. If in
doubt, please refer to the documentation of your operating system, in particular the documen-
tation about gettext.
To enable messages to be translated to the user's preferred language, NLS must have been selected at
```
build time (configure --enable-nls). All other locale support is built in automatically.
```
23.1.2. Behavior
The locale settings influence the following SQL features:
• Sort order in queries using ORDER BY or the standard comparison operators on textual data
• The upper, lower, and initcap functions
```
• Pattern matching operators (LIKE, SIMILAR TO, and POSIX-style regular expressions); locales
```
affect both case insensitive matching and the classification of characters by character-class regular
expressions
• The to_char family of functions
• The ability to use indexes with LIKE clauses
The drawback of using locales other than C or POSIX in PostgreSQL is its performance impact. It
slows character handling and prevents ordinary indexes from being used by LIKE. For this reason use
locales only if you actually need them.
As a workaround to allow PostgreSQL to use indexes with LIKE clauses under a non-C locale, several
custom operator classes exist. These allow the creation of an index that performs a strict character-by-
character comparison, ignoring locale comparison rules. Refer to Section 11.10 for more information.
Another approach is to create indexes using the C collation, as discussed in Section 23.2.
761
Localization
23.1.3. Selecting Locales
Locales can be selected in different scopes depending on requirements. The above overview showed
how locales are specified using initdb to set the defaults for the entire cluster. The following list
shows where locales can be selected. Each item provides the defaults for the subsequent items, and
each lower item allows overriding the defaults on a finer granularity.
1. As explained above, the environment of the operating system provides the defaults for the locales
of a newly initialized database cluster. In many cases, this is enough: if the operating system is
configured for the desired language/territory, by default PostgreSQL will also behave according
to that locale.
2. As shown above, command-line options for initdb specify the locale settings for a newly ini-
tialized database cluster. Use this if the operating system does not have the locale configuration
you want for your database system.
3. A locale can be selected separately for each database. The SQL command CREATE DATABASE
and its command-line equivalent createdb have options for that. Use this for example if a data-
base cluster houses databases for multiple tenants with different requirements.
4. Locale settings can be made for individual table columns. This uses an SQL object called colla-
tion and is explained in Section 23.2. Use this for example to sort data in different languages or
customize the sort order of a particular table.
5. Finally, locales can be selected for an individual query. Again, this uses SQL collation objects. This
could be used to change the sort order based on run-time choices or for ad-hoc experimentation.
23.1.4. Locale Providers
A locale provider specifies which library defines the locale behavior for collations and character clas-
sifications.
The commands and tools that select the locale settings, as described above, each have an option to
select the locale provider. Here is an example to initialize a database cluster using the ICU provider:
initdb --locale-provider=icu --icu-locale=en
See the description of the respective commands and programs for details. Note that you can mix locale
providers at different granularities, for example use libc by default for the cluster but have one
database that uses the icu provider, and then have collation objects using either provider within those
databases.
Regardless of the locale provider, the operating system is still used to provide some locale-aware
```
behavior, such as messages (see lc_messages).
```
The available locale providers are listed below:
builtin
The builtin provider uses built-in operations. Only the C, C.UTF-8, and PG_UNI-
CODE_FAST locales are supported for this provider.
The C locale behavior is identical to the C locale in the libc provider. When using this locale, the
behavior may depend on the database encoding.
The C.UTF-8 locale is available only for when the database encoding is UTF-8, and the behav-
ior is based on Unicode. The collation uses the code point values only. The regular expression
character classes are based on the "POSIX Compatible" semantics, and the case mapping is the
"simple" variant.
762
Localization
The PG_UNICODE_FAST locale is available only when the database encoding is UTF-8, and
the behavior is based on Unicode. The collation uses the code point values only. The regular
expression character classes are based on the "Standard" semantics, and the case mapping is the
"full" variant.
icu
The icu provider uses the external ICU library. PostgreSQL must have been configured with
support.
ICU provides collation and character classification behavior that is independent of the operating
system and database encoding, which is preferable if you expect to transition to other platforms
without any change in results. LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE can be set independently of the
ICU locale.
Note
For the ICU provider, results may depend on the version of the ICU library used, as it is
updated to reflect changes in natural language over time.
libc
The libc provider uses the operating system's C library. The collation and character classifica-
tion behavior is controlled by the settings LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE, so they cannot be set
independently.
Note
The same locale name may have different behavior on different platforms when using the
libc provider.
23.1.5. ICU Locales
23.1.5.1. ICU Locale Names
The ICU format for the locale name is a Language Tag.
```
CREATE COLLATION mycollation1 (provider = icu, locale = 'ja-JP');
```
```
CREATE COLLATION mycollation2 (provider = icu, locale = 'fr');
```
23.1.5.2. Locale Canonicalization and Validation
When defining a new ICU collation object or database with ICU as the provider, the given locale name
```
is transformed ("canonicalized") into a language tag if not already in that form. For instance,
```
```
CREATE COLLATION mycollation3 (provider = icu, locale = 'en-US-u-
```
```
kn-true');
```
```
NOTICE: using standard form "en-US-u-kn" for locale "en-US-u-kn-
```
true"
```
CREATE COLLATION mycollation4 (provider = icu, locale =
```
```
'de_DE.utf8');
```
```
NOTICE: using standard form "de-DE" for locale "de_DE.utf8"
```
763
Localization
If you see this notice, ensure that the provider and locale are the expected result. For consistent
results when using the ICU provider, specify the canonical language tag instead of relying on the
transformation.
A locale with no language name, or the special language name root, is transformed to have the
```
language und ("undefined").
```
ICU can transform most libc locale names, as well as some other formats, into language tags for easier
transition to ICU. If a libc locale name is used in ICU, it may not have precisely the same behavior
as in libc.
If there is a problem interpreting the locale name, or if the locale name represents a language or region
that ICU does not recognize, you will see the following warning:
```
CREATE COLLATION nonsense (provider = icu, locale = 'nonsense');
```
```
WARNING: ICU locale "nonsense" has unknown language "nonsense"
```
```
HINT: To disable ICU locale validation, set parameter
```
icu_validation_level to DISABLED.
CREATE COLLATION
icu_validation_level controls how the message is reported. Unless set to ERROR, the collation will
still be created, but the behavior may not be what the user intended.
23.1.5.3. Language Tag
A language tag, defined in BCP 47, is a standardized identifier used to identify languages, regions,
and other information about a locale.
```
Basic language tags are simply language-region; or even just language. The language is
```
```
a language code (e.g. fr for French), and region is a region code (e.g. CA for Canada). Examples:
```
ja-JP, de, or fr-CA.
Collation settings may be included in the language tag to customize collation behavior. ICU allows
```
extensive customization, such as sensitivity (or insensitivity) to accents, case, and punctuation; treat-
```
```
ment of digits within text; and many other options to satisfy a variety of uses.
```
To include this additional collation information in a language tag, append -u, which indicates there
are additional collation settings, followed by one or more -key-value pairs. The key is the key
for a collation setting and value is a valid value for that setting. For boolean settings, the -key may
be specified without a corresponding -value, which implies a value of true.
For example, the language tag en-US-u-kn-ks-level2 means the locale with the English lan-
guage in the US region, with collation settings kn set to true and ks set to level2. Those settings
mean the collation will be case-insensitive and treat a sequence of digits as a single number:
```
CREATE COLLATION mycollation5 (provider = icu, deterministic =
```
```
false, locale = 'en-US-u-kn-ks-level2');
```
```
SELECT 'aB' = 'Ab' COLLATE mycollation5 as result;
```
result
--------
t
```
(1 row)
```
```
SELECT 'N-45' < 'N-123' COLLATE mycollation5 as result;
```
result
--------
t
```
(1 row)
```
764
Localization
See Section 23.2.3 for details and additional examples of using language tags with custom collation
information for the locale.
23.1.6. Problems
If locale support doesn't work according to the explanation above, check that the locale support in your
operating system is correctly configured. To check what locales are installed on your system, you can
use the command locale -a if your operating system provides it.
Check that PostgreSQL is actually using the locale that you think it is. The LC_COLLATE and LC_C-
TYPE settings are determined when a database is created, and cannot be changed except by creating
a new database. Other locale settings including LC_MESSAGES and LC_MONETARY are initially de-
termined by the environment the server is started in, but can be changed on-the-fly. You can check
the active locale settings using the SHOW command.
The directory src/test/locale in the source distribution contains a test suite for PostgreSQL's
locale support.
Client applications that handle server-side errors by parsing the text of the error message will obviously
have problems when the server's messages are in a different language. Authors of such applications
are advised to make use of the error code scheme instead.
Maintaining catalogs of message translations requires the on-going efforts of many volunteers that
want to see PostgreSQL speak their preferred language well. If messages in your language are currently
not available or not fully translated, your assistance would be appreciated. If you want to help, refer
to Chapter 56 or write to the developers' mailing list.
23.2. Collation Support
The collation feature allows specifying the sort order and character classification behavior of data per-
column, or even per-operation. This alleviates the restriction that the LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE
settings of a database cannot be changed after its creation.
23.2.1. Concepts
```
Conceptually, every expression of a collatable data type has a collation. (The built-in collatable data
```
types are text, varchar, and char. User-defined base types can also be marked collatable, and
```
of course a domain over a collatable data type is collatable.) If the expression is a column reference,
```
the collation of the expression is the defined collation of the column. If the expression is a constant,
the collation is the default collation of the data type of the constant. The collation of a more complex
expression is derived from the collations of its inputs, as described below.
The collation of an expression can be the “default” collation, which means the locale settings defined
for the database. It is also possible for an expression's collation to be indeterminate. In such cases,
ordering operations and other operations that need to know the collation will fail.
When the database system has to perform an ordering or a character classification, it uses the collation
of the input expression. This happens, for example, with ORDER BY clauses and function or operator
calls such as <. The collation to apply for an ORDER BY clause is simply the collation of the sort
key. The collation to apply for a function or operator call is derived from the arguments, as described
below. In addition to comparison operators, collations are taken into account by functions that convert
```
between lower and upper case letters, such as lower, upper, and initcap; by pattern matching
```
```
operators; and by to_char and related functions.
```
For a function or operator call, the collation that is derived by examining the argument collations is
used at run time for performing the specified operation. If the result of the function or operator call is of
a collatable data type, the collation is also used at parse time as the defined collation of the function or
operator expression, in case there is a surrounding expression that requires knowledge of its collation.
765
Localization
The collation derivation of an expression can be implicit or explicit. This distinction affects how col-
lations are combined when multiple different collations appear in an expression. An explicit collation
```
derivation occurs when a COLLATE clause is used; all other collation derivations are implicit. When
```
multiple collations need to be combined, for example in a function call, the following rules are used:
1. If any input expression has an explicit collation derivation, then all explicitly derived collations
among the input expressions must be the same, otherwise an error is raised. If any explicitly derived
collation is present, that is the result of the collation combination.
2. Otherwise, all input expressions must have the same implicit collation derivation or the default
collation. If any non-default collation is present, that is the result of the collation combination.
Otherwise, the result is the default collation.
3. If there are conflicting non-default implicit collations among the input expressions, then the com-
bination is deemed to have indeterminate collation. This is not an error condition unless the par-
ticular function being invoked requires knowledge of the collation it should apply. If it does, an
error will be raised at run-time.
For example, consider this table definition:
```
CREATE TABLE test1 (
```
a text COLLATE "de_DE",
b text COLLATE "es_ES",
...
```
);
```
Then in
```
SELECT a < 'foo' FROM test1;
```
the < comparison is performed according to de_DE rules, because the expression combines an im-
plicitly derived collation with the default collation. But in
```
SELECT a < ('foo' COLLATE "fr_FR") FROM test1;
```
the comparison is performed using fr_FR rules, because the explicit collation derivation overrides
the implicit one. Furthermore, given
```
SELECT a < b FROM test1;
```
the parser cannot determine which collation to apply, since the a and b columns have conflicting
implicit collations. Since the < operator does need to know which collation to use, this will result in an
error. The error can be resolved by attaching an explicit collation specifier to either input expression,
```
thus:
```
```
SELECT a < b COLLATE "de_DE" FROM test1;
```
or equivalently
```
SELECT a COLLATE "de_DE" < b FROM test1;
```
On the other hand, the structurally similar case
```
SELECT a || b FROM test1;
```
does not result in an error, because the || operator does not care about collations: its result is the
same regardless of the collation.
766
Localization
The collation assigned to a function or operator's combined input expressions is also considered to
apply to the function or operator's result, if the function or operator delivers a result of a collatable
data type. So, in
```
SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || 'foo';
```
the ordering will be done according to de_DE rules. But this query:
```
SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b;
```
results in an error, because even though the || operator doesn't need to know a collation, the ORDER
BY clause does. As before, the conflict can be resolved with an explicit collation specifier:
```
SELECT * FROM test1 ORDER BY a || b COLLATE "fr_FR";
```
23.2.2. Managing Collations
A collation is an SQL schema object that maps an SQL name to locales provided by libraries installed
in the operating system. A collation definition has a provider that specifies which library supplies the
locale data. One standard provider name is libc, which uses the locales provided by the operating
system C library. These are the locales used by most tools provided by the operating system. Another
provider is icu, which uses the external ICU library. ICU locales can only be used if support for ICU
was configured when PostgreSQL was built.
A collation object provided by libc maps to a combination of LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE set-
```
tings, as accepted by the setlocale() system library call. (As the name would suggest, the main
```
purpose of a collation is to set LC_COLLATE, which controls the sort order. But it is rarely necessary
in practice to have an LC_CTYPE setting that is different from LC_COLLATE, so it is more conve-
nient to collect these under one concept than to create another infrastructure for setting LC_CTYPE
```
per expression.) Also, a libc collation is tied to a character set encoding (see Section 23.3). The same
```
collation name may exist for different encodings.
A collation object provided by icu maps to a named collator provided by the ICU library. ICU does not
support separate “collate” and “ctype” settings, so they are always the same. Also, ICU collations are
independent of the encoding, so there is always only one ICU collation of a given name in a database.
23.2.2.1. Standard Collations
On all platforms, the following collations are supported:
unicode
This SQL standard collation sorts using the Unicode Collation Algorithm with the Default Uni-
code Collation Element Table. It is available in all encodings. ICU support is required to use this
```
collation, and behavior may change if PostgreSQL is built with a different version of ICU. (This
```
```
collation has the same behavior as the ICU root locale; see und-x-icu (for “undefined”).)
```
ucs_basic
This SQL standard collation sorts using the Unicode code point values rather than natural language
order, and only the ASCII letters “A” through “Z” are treated as letters. The behavior is efficient
```
and stable across all versions. Only available for encoding UTF8. (This collation has the same
```
```
behavior as the libc locale specification C in UTF8 encoding.)
```
pg_unicode_fast
This collation sorts by Unicode code point values rather than natural language order. For the
functions lower, initcap, and upper it uses Unicode full case mapping. For pattern matching
767
Localization
```
(including regular expressions), it uses the Standard variant of Unicode Compatibility Properties1.
```
Behavior is efficient and stable within a Postgres major version. It is only available for encoding
UTF8.
pg_c_utf8
This collation sorts by Unicode code point values rather than natural language order. For the func-
tions lower, initcap, and upper, it uses Unicode simple case mapping. For pattern matching
```
(including regular expressions), it uses the POSIX Compatible variant of Unicode Compatibility
```
Properties2. Behavior is efficient and stable within a PostgreSQL major version. This collation
is only available for encoding UTF8.
```
C (equivalent to POSIX)
```
The C and POSIX collations are based on “traditional C” behavior. They sort by byte values rather
than natural language order, and only the ASCII letters “A” through “Z” are treated as letters. The
behavior is efficient and stable across all versions for a given database encoding, but behavior
may vary between different database encodings.
default
The default collation selects the locale specified at database creation time.
Additional collations may be available depending on operating system support. The efficiency and
stability of these additional collations depend on the collation provider, the provider version, and the
locale.
23.2.2.2. Predefined Collations
```
If the operating system provides support for using multiple locales within a single program (newlo-
```
```
cale and related functions), or if support for ICU is configured, then when a database cluster is
```
initialized, initdb populates the system catalog pg_collation with collations based on all the
locales it finds in the operating system at the time.
To inspect the currently available locales, use the query SELECT * FROM pg_collation, or
the command \dOS+ in psql.
23.2.2.2.1. libc Collations
For example, the operating system might provide a locale named de_DE.utf8. initdb would
then create a collation named de_DE.utf8 for encoding UTF8 that has both LC_COLLATE and
LC_CTYPE set to de_DE.utf8. It will also create a collation with the .utf8 tag stripped off the
name. So you could also use the collation under the name de_DE, which is less cumbersome to write
and makes the name less encoding-dependent. Note that, nevertheless, the initial set of collation names
is platform-dependent.
The default set of collations provided by libc map directly to the locales installed in the operating
system, which can be listed using the command locale -a. In case a libc collation is needed
that has different values for LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE, or if new locales are installed in the
operating system after the database system was initialized, then a new collation may be created using
the CREATE COLLATION command. New operating system locales can also be imported en masse
```
using the pg_import_system_collations() function.
```
Within any particular database, only collations that use that database's encoding are of interest. Oth-
er entries in pg_collation are ignored. Thus, a stripped collation name such as de_DE can be
considered unique within a given database even though it would not be unique globally. Use of the
stripped collation names is recommended, since it will make one fewer thing you need to change if
you decide to change to another database encoding. Note however that the default, C, and POSIX
collations can be used regardless of the database encoding.

2 https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Compatibility_Properties
768
Localization
PostgreSQL considers distinct collation objects to be incompatible even when they have identical
properties. Thus for example,
```
SELECT a COLLATE "C" < b COLLATE "POSIX" FROM test1;
```
will draw an error even though the C and POSIX collations have identical behaviors. Mixing stripped
and non-stripped collation names is therefore not recommended.
23.2.2.2.2. ICU Collations
With ICU, it is not sensible to enumerate all possible locale names. ICU uses a particular naming
system for locales, but there are many more ways to name a locale than there are actually distinct
locales. initdb uses the ICU APIs to extract a set of distinct locales to populate the initial set of
collations. Collations provided by ICU are created in the SQL environment with names in BCP 47
language tag format, with a “private use” extension -x-icu appended, to distinguish them from libc
locales.
Here are some example collations that might be created:
de-x-icu
German collation, default variant
de-AT-x-icu
German collation for Austria, default variant
```
(There are also, say, de-DE-x-icu or de-CH-x-icu, but as of this writing, they are equiv-
```
```
alent to de-x-icu.)
```
```
und-x-icu (for “undefined”)
```
ICU “root” collation. Use this to get a reasonable language-agnostic sort order.
```
Some (less frequently used) encodings are not supported by ICU. When the database encoding is one
```
of these, ICU collation entries in pg_collation are ignored. Attempting to use one will draw an
error along the lines of “collation "de-x-icu" for encoding "WIN874" does not exist”.
23.2.2.3. Creating New Collation Objects
If the standard and predefined collations are not sufficient, users can create their own collation objects
using the SQL command CREATE COLLATION.
The standard and predefined collations are in the schema pg_catalog, like all predefined objects.
User-defined collations should be created in user schemas. This also ensures that they are saved by
pg_dump.
23.2.2.3.1. libc Collations
New libc collations can be created like this:
```
CREATE COLLATION german (provider = libc, locale = 'de_DE');
```
The exact values that are acceptable for the locale clause in this command depend on the operating
system. On Unix-like systems, the command locale -a will show a list.
Since the predefined libc collations already include all collations defined in the operating system when
the database instance is initialized, it is not often necessary to manually create new ones. Reasons
```
might be if a different naming system is desired (in which case see also Section 23.2.2.3.3) or if
```
```
the operating system has been upgraded to provide new locale definitions (in which case see also
```
```
pg_import_system_collations()).
```
769
Localization
23.2.2.3.2. ICU Collations
ICU collations can be created like:
```
CREATE COLLATION german (provider = icu, locale = 'de-DE');
```
ICU locales are specified as a BCP 47 Language Tag, but can also accept most libc-style locale names.
If possible, libc-style locale names are transformed into language tags.
New ICU collations can customize collation behavior extensively by including collation attributes in
the language tag. See Section 23.2.3 for details and examples.
23.2.2.3.3. Copying Collations
The command CREATE COLLATION can also be used to create a new collation from an existing
collation, which can be useful to be able to use operating-system-independent collation names in ap-
plications, create compatibility names, or use an ICU-provided collation under a more readable name.
For example:
```
CREATE COLLATION german FROM "de_DE";
```
```
CREATE COLLATION french FROM "fr-x-icu";
```
23.2.2.4. Nondeterministic Collations
A collation is either deterministic or nondeterministic. A deterministic collation uses deterministic
comparisons, which means that it considers strings to be equal only if they consist of the same byte
sequence. Nondeterministic comparison may determine strings to be equal even if they consist of
different bytes. Typical situations include case-insensitive comparison, accent-insensitive comparison,
as well as comparison of strings in different Unicode normal forms. It is up to the collation provider
```
to actually implement such insensitive comparisons; the deterministic flag only determines whether
```
ties are to be broken using bytewise comparison. See also Unicode Technical Standard 103 for more
information on the terminology.
To create a nondeterministic collation, specify the property deterministic = false to CREATE
COLLATION, for example:
```
CREATE COLLATION ndcoll (provider = icu, locale = 'und',
```
```
deterministic = false);
```
This example would use the standard Unicode collation in a nondeterministic way. In particular, this
would allow strings in different normal forms to be compared correctly. More interesting examples
make use of the ICU customization facilities explained above. For example:
```
CREATE COLLATION case_insensitive (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-
```
```
ks-level2', deterministic = false);
```
```
CREATE COLLATION ignore_accents (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-
```
```
ks-level1-kc-true', deterministic = false);
```
All standard and predefined collations are deterministic, all user-defined collations are deterministic
by default. While nondeterministic collations give a more “correct” behavior, especially when consid-
ering the full power of Unicode and its many special cases, they also have some drawbacks. Foremost,
their use leads to a performance penalty. Note, in particular, that B-tree cannot use deduplication with
indexes that use a nondeterministic collation. Also, certain operations are not possible with nondeter-
ministic collations, such as some pattern matching operations. Therefore, they should be used only in
cases where they are specifically wanted.

Tip
To deal with text in different Unicode normalization forms, it is also an option to use the
functions/expressions normalize and is normalized to preprocess or check the strings,
instead of using nondeterministic collations. There are different trade-offs for each approach.
23.2.3. ICU Custom Collations
ICU allows extensive control over collation behavior by defining new collations with collation settings
as a part of the language tag. These settings can modify the collation order to suit a variety of needs.
For instance:
-- ignore differences in accents and case
```
CREATE COLLATION ignore_accent_case (provider = icu, deterministic
```
```
= false, locale = 'und-u-ks-level1');
```
```
SELECT 'Å' = 'A' COLLATE ignore_accent_case; -- true
```
```
SELECT 'z' = 'Z' COLLATE ignore_accent_case; -- true
```
-- upper case letters sort before lower case.
```
CREATE COLLATION upper_first (provider = icu, locale = 'und-u-kf-
```
```
upper');
```
```
SELECT 'B' < 'b' COLLATE upper_first; -- true
```
-- treat digits numerically and ignore punctuation
```
CREATE COLLATION num_ignore_punct (provider = icu, deterministic =
```
```
false, locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-kn');
```
```
SELECT 'id-45' < 'id-123' COLLATE num_ignore_punct; -- true
```
```
SELECT 'w;x*y-z' = 'wxyz' COLLATE num_ignore_punct; -- true
```
Many of the available options are described in Section 23.2.3.2, or see Section 23.2.3.5 for more
details.
23.2.3.1. ICU Comparison Levels
```
Comparison of two strings (collation) in ICU is determined by a multi-level process, where textual
```
features are grouped into "levels". Treatment of each level is controlled by the collation settings.
Higher levels correspond to finer textual features.
Table 23.1 shows which textual feature differences are considered significant when determining equal-
ity at the given level. The Unicode character U+2063 is an invisible separator, and as seen in the
table, is ignored for at all levels of comparison less than identic.

```
aonly with ka-shifted; see Table 23.2
```
771
Localization
At every level, even with full normalization off, basic normalization is performed. For example, 'á'
may be composed of the code points U&'\0061\0301' or the single code point U&'\00E1', and
those sequences will be considered equal even at the identic level. To treat any difference in code
point representation as distinct, use a collation created with deterministic set to true.
23.2.3.1.1. Collation Level Examples
```
CREATE COLLATION level3 (provider = icu, deterministic = false,
```
```
locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-level3');
```
```
CREATE COLLATION level4 (provider = icu, deterministic = false,
```
```
locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-level4');
```
```
CREATE COLLATION identic (provider = icu, deterministic = false,
```
```
locale = 'und-u-ka-shifted-ks-identic');
```
-- invisible separator ignored at all levels except identic
```
SELECT 'ab' = U&'a\2063b' COLLATE level4; -- true
```
```
SELECT 'ab' = U&'a\2063b' COLLATE identic; -- false
```
-- punctuation ignored at level3 but not at level 4
```
SELECT 'x-y' = 'x_y' COLLATE level3; -- true
```
```
SELECT 'x-y' = 'x_y' COLLATE level4; -- false

```
noignore If set to shifted, causes some characters (e.g.

son. Key ks must be set to level3 or lower to
take effect. Set key kv to control which charac-
ter classes are ignored.
kb true, false false Backwards comparison for the level 2 differ-
ences. For example, locale und-u-kb sorts
'àe' before 'aé'.
kc true, false false Separates case into a "level 2.5" that falls be-
tween accents and other level 3 features.
If set to true and ks is set to level1, will ig-
nore accents but take case into account.
kf upper, lower,

false If set to upper, upper case sorts before lower
case. If set to lower, lower case sorts before
upper case. If set to false, the sort depends on
the rules of the locale.
kn true, false false If set to true, numbers within a string are treat-
ed as a single numeric value rather than a se-
quence of digits. For example, 'id-45' sorts
before 'id-123'.

mance. Basic normalization is performed even
when set to false. Locales for languages that
require full normalization typically enable it by

Full normalization is important in some cases,
such as when multiple accents are applied to a
single character. For example, the code point
sequences U&'\0065\0323\0302' and
U&'\0065\0302\0323' represent an e with
circumflex and dot-below accents applied in dif-
ferent orders. With full normalization on, these
```
code point sequences are treated as equal; other-
```
wise they are unequal.

rency
punct Classes of characters ignored during comparison
at level 3. Setting to a later value includes earlier
```
values; e.g. symbol also includes punct and
```
space in the characters to be ignored. Key ka
must be set to shifted and key ks must be set
to level3 or lower to take effect.
Defaults may depend on locale. The above table is not meant to be complete. See Section 23.2.3.5
for additional options and details.
Note
For many collation settings, you must create the collation with deterministic set to
```
false for the setting to have the desired effect (see Section 23.2.2.4). Additionally, some
```
```
settings only take effect when the key ka is set to shifted (see Table 23.2).

```
```
CREATE COLLATION special (provider = icu, locale = 'en-u-kf-upper-kr-

```
grek-latn');
```
Combines both of the above options.
23.2.3.4. ICU Tailoring Rules
If the options provided by the collation settings shown above are not sufficient, the order of collation
elements can be changed with tailoring rules, whose syntax is detailed at https://unicode-org.github.io/
icu/userguide/collation/customization/.
This small example creates a collation based on the root locale with a tailoring rule:
```
CREATE COLLATION custom (provider = icu, locale = 'und', rules =
```
```
'&V << w <<< W');
```
With this rule, the letter “W” is sorted after “V”, but is treated as a secondary difference similar to an
```
accent. Rules like this are contained in the locale definitions of some languages. (Of course, if a locale
```
```
definition already contains the desired rules, then they don't need to be specified again explicitly.)
```
Here is a more complex example. The following statement sets up a collation named ebcdic with
rules to sort US-ASCII characters in the order of the EBCDIC encoding.
```
CREATE COLLATION ebcdic (provider = icu, locale = 'und',
```
```
rules = $$
```
```
& ' ' < '.' < '<' < '(' < '+' < \|
```
```
< '&' < '!' < '$' < '*' < ')' < ';'
```
< '-' < '/' < ',' < '%' < '_' < '>' < '?'
< '`' < ':' < '#' < '@' < \' < '=' < '"'
<*a-r < '~' <*s-z < '^' < '[' < ']'
```
< '{' <*A-I < '}' <*J-R < '\' <*S-Z <*0-9
```
```
$$);
```
SELECT c
```
FROM (VALUES ('a'), ('b'), ('A'), ('B'), ('1'), ('2'), ('!'),
```
```
('^')) AS x(c)

```
ORDER BY c COLLATE ebcdic;

23.3. Character Set Support
```
The character set support in PostgreSQL allows you to store text in a variety of character sets (also
```
```
called encodings), including single-byte character sets such as the ISO 8859 series and multiple-byte
```
```
character sets such as EUC (Extended Unix Code), UTF-8, and Mule internal code. All supported
```
character sets can be used transparently by clients, but a few are not supported for use within the
```
server (that is, as a server-side encoding). The default character set is selected while initializing your
```
PostgreSQL database cluster using initdb. It can be overridden when you create a database, so you
can have multiple databases each with a different character set.
An important restriction, however, is that each database's character set must be compatible with the
```
database's LC_CTYPE (character classification) and LC_COLLATE (string sort order) locale settings.
```
For C or POSIX locale, any character set is allowed, but for other libc-provided locales there is only
```
one character set that will work correctly. (On Windows, however, UTF-8 encoding can be used with
```
```
any locale.) If you have ICU support configured, ICU-provided locales can be used with most but not
```
all server-side encodings.

Not all client APIs support all the listed character sets. For example, the PostgreSQL JDBC driver
does not support MULE_INTERNAL, LATIN6, LATIN8, and LATIN10.
The SQL_ASCII setting behaves considerably differently from the other settings. When the server
character set is SQL_ASCII, the server interprets byte values 0–127 according to the ASCII standard,
while byte values 128–255 are taken as uninterpreted characters. No encoding conversion will be
done when the setting is SQL_ASCII. Thus, this setting is not so much a declaration that a specific
encoding is in use, as a declaration of ignorance about the encoding. In most cases, if you are working
with any non-ASCII data, it is unwise to use the SQL_ASCII setting because PostgreSQL will be
unable to help you by converting or validating non-ASCII characters.
23.3.2. Setting the Character Set
```
initdb defines the default character set (encoding) for a PostgreSQL cluster. For example,
```
777
Localization
initdb -E EUC_JP
```
sets the default character set to EUC_JP (Extended Unix Code for Japanese). You can use --en-
```
coding instead of -E if you prefer longer option strings. If no -E or --encoding option is given,
initdb attempts to determine the appropriate encoding to use based on the specified or default locale.
You can specify a non-default encoding at database creation time, provided that the encoding is com-
patible with the selected locale:
createdb -E EUC_KR -T template0 --lc-collate=ko_KR.euckr --lc-
```
ctype=ko_KR.euckr korean
```
This will create a database named korean that uses the character set EUC_KR, and locale ko_KR.
Another way to accomplish this is to use this SQL command:
CREATE DATABASE korean WITH ENCODING 'EUC_KR'
```
LC_COLLATE='ko_KR.euckr' LC_CTYPE='ko_KR.euckr'
```
```
TEMPLATE=template0;
```
Notice that the above commands specify copying the template0 database. When copying any oth-
er database, the encoding and locale settings cannot be changed from those of the source database,
because that might result in corrupt data. For more information see Section 22.3.
The encoding for a database is stored in the system catalog pg_database. You can see it by using
the psql -l option or the \l command.
$ psql -l

Important
On most modern operating systems, PostgreSQL can determine which character set is implied
by the LC_CTYPE setting, and it will enforce that only the matching database encoding is
used. On older systems it is your responsibility to ensure that you use the encoding expected
by the locale you have selected. A mistake in this area is likely to lead to strange behavior of
locale-dependent operations such as sorting.
PostgreSQL will allow superusers to create databases with SQL_ASCII encoding even when
LC_CTYPE is not C or POSIX. As noted above, SQL_ASCII does not enforce that the data
stored in the database has any particular encoding, and so this choice poses risks of locale-de-
778
Localization
pendent misbehavior. Using this combination of settings is deprecated and may someday be
forbidden altogether.
23.3.3. Automatic Character Set Conversion Between
Server and Client
PostgreSQL supports automatic character set conversion between server and client for many combi-
```
nations of character sets (Section 23.3.4 shows which ones).
```
```
To enable automatic character set conversion, you have to tell PostgreSQL the character set (encoding)
```
you would like to use in the client. There are several ways to accomplish this:
• Using the \encoding command in psql. \encoding allows you to change client encoding on
the fly. For example, to change the encoding to SJIS, type:
\encoding SJIS
```
• libpq (Section 32.11) has functions to control the client encoding.
```
• Using SET client_encoding TO. Setting the client encoding can be done with this SQL
```
command:
```
```
SET CLIENT_ENCODING TO 'value';
```
Also you can use the standard SQL syntax SET NAMES for this purpose:
```
SET NAMES 'value';
```
To query the current client encoding:
```
SHOW client_encoding;
```
To return to the default encoding:
```
RESET client_encoding;
```
• Using PGCLIENTENCODING. If the environment variable PGCLIENTENCODING is defined in
the client's environment, that client encoding is automatically selected when a connection to the
```
server is made. (This can subsequently be overridden using any of the other methods mentioned
```
```
above.)
```
• Using the configuration variable client_encoding. If the client_encoding variable is set, that
```
client encoding is automatically selected when a connection to the server is made. (This can subse-
```
```
quently be overridden using any of the other methods mentioned above.)
```
If the conversion of a particular character is not possible — suppose you chose EUC_JP for the server
and LATIN1 for the client, and some Japanese characters are returned that do not have a representation
in LATIN1 — an error is reported.
If the client character set is defined as SQL_ASCII, encoding conversion is disabled, regardless of the
```
server's character set. (However, if the server's character set is not SQL_ASCII, the server will still
```
```
check that incoming data is valid for that encoding; so the net effect is as though the client character
```
```
set were the same as the server's.) Just as for the server, use of SQL_ASCII is unwise unless you are
```
working with all-ASCII data.

23.3.4. Available Character Set Conversions
PostgreSQL allows conversion between any two character sets for which a conversion function is list-
ed in the pg_conversion system catalog. PostgreSQL comes with some predefined conversions,
as summarized in Table 23.4 and shown in more detail in Table 23.5. You can create a new conversion
```
using the SQL command CREATE CONVERSION. (To be used for automatic client/server conver-
```
```
sions, a conversion must be marked as “default” for its character set pair.)

a The conversion names follow a standard naming scheme: The official name of the source encoding with all non-alphanumeric
characters replaced by underscores, followed by _to_, followed by the similarly processed destination encoding name. There-
fore, these names sometimes deviate from the customary encoding names shown in Table 23.3.
