Chapter 49. Archive Modules
```
PostgreSQL provides infrastructure to create custom modules for continuous archiving (see Sec-
```
```
tion 25.3). While archiving via a shell command (i.e., archive_command) is much simpler, a custom
```
archive module will often be considerably more robust and performant.
When a custom archive_library is configured, PostgreSQL will submit completed WAL files to the
module, and the server will avoid recycling or removing these WAL files until the module indicates
that the files were successfully archived. It is ultimately up to the module to decide what to do with
each WAL file, but many recommendations are listed at Section 25.3.1.
```
Archiving modules must at least consist of an initialization function (see Section 49.1) and the required
```
```
callbacks (see Section 49.2). However, archive modules are also permitted to do much more (e.g.,
```
```
declare GUCs and register background workers).
```
The contrib/basic_archive module contains a working example, which demonstrates some
useful techniques.
49.1. Initialization Functions
An archive library is loaded by dynamically loading a shared library with the archive_library's name
as the library base name. The normal library search path is used to locate the library. To provide the
required archive module callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually an archive module, it
needs to provide a function named _PG_archive_module_init. The result of the function must
be a pointer to a struct of type ArchiveModuleCallbacks, which contains everything that the
core code needs to know to make use of the archive module. The return value needs to be of server
lifetime, which is typically achieved by defining it as a static const variable in global scope.
typedef struct ArchiveModuleCallbacks
```
{
```
```
ArchiveStartupCB startup_cb;
```
```
ArchiveCheckConfiguredCB check_configured_cb;
```
```
ArchiveFileCB archive_file_cb;
```
```
ArchiveShutdownCB shutdown_cb;
```
```
} ArchiveModuleCallbacks;
```
```
typedef const ArchiveModuleCallbacks *(*ArchiveModuleInit) (void);
```
Only the archive_file_cb callback is required. The others are optional.
49.2. Archive Module Callbacks
The archive callbacks define the actual archiving behavior of the module. The server will call them
as required to process each individual WAL file.
49.2.1. Startup Callback
The startup_cb callback is called shortly after the module is loaded. This callback can be used to
perform any additional initialization required. If the archive module has any state, it can use state-
>private_data to store it.
```
typedef void (*ArchiveStartupCB) (ArchiveModuleState *state);
```

49.2.2. Check Callback
The check_configured_cb callback is called to determine whether the module is fully config-
```
ured and ready to accept WAL files (e.g., its configuration parameters are set to valid values). If no
```
check_configured_cb is defined, the server always assumes the module is configured.
```
typedef bool (*ArchiveCheckConfiguredCB) (ArchiveModuleState
```
```
*state);
```
If true is returned, the server will proceed with archiving the file by calling the archive_file_cb
callback. If false is returned, archiving will not proceed, and the archiver will emit the following
message to the server log:
```
WARNING: archive_mode enabled, yet archiving is not configured
```
In the latter case, the server will periodically call this function, and archiving will proceed only when
it returns true.
Note
When returning false, it may be useful to append some additional information to the generic
warning message. To do that, provide a message to the arch_module_check_errde-
```
tail macro before returning false. Like errdetail(), this macro accepts a format
```
string followed by an optional list of arguments. The resulting string will be emitted as the
DETAIL line of the warning message.
49.2.3. Archive Callback
The archive_file_cb callback is called to archive a single WAL file.
```
typedef bool (*ArchiveFileCB) (ArchiveModuleState *state, const
```
```
char *file, const char *path);
```
If true is returned, the server proceeds as if the file was successfully archived, which may include
recycling or removing the original WAL file. If false is returned or an error is thrown, the server
will keep the original WAL file and retry archiving later. file will contain just the file name of the
```
WAL file to archive, while path contains the full path of the WAL file (including the file name).
```
Note
The archive_file_cb callback is called in a short-lived memory context that will be reset
between invocations. If you need longer-lived storage, create a memory context in the module's
startup_cb callback.
49.2.4. Shutdown Callback
```
The shutdown_cb callback is called when the archiver process exits (e.g., after an error) or the
```
value of archive_library changes. If no shutdown_cb is defined, no special action is taken in these
situations. If the archive module has any state, this callback should free it to avoid leaks.
